### Links within this Sub Menu
> This submenu links to two different blogs in my website. One is a Jupyter Notebook while the other is a regular Blog Post. They both contain fragments of JavaScript and HTML and are designed by such.
- JavaScript Kernel Post: A Jupyter Notebook that shows usage of Jupyter Javascript kernel in code and in text as well.
- HTML and JavaScript fragments: A _post that uses both JavaScript and HTML to design the post and create a table.
