    "\n",
    "- Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomena from the real world\n",
    "- Purposes:\n",
    "    - Drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world\n",
    "- Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon\n",
    "- Often, when developing a simulation, it is necessary to remove specific details or simplify aspects\n",
    "- Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded\n",
    "- Simulations allow the formulation of hypotheses under consideration\n",
    "- Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators\n",
    "- Examples: \n",
    "    - Rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions...\n",
    "- A simulation allows us to explore this question without real world contraints of money, time, safety\n",
    "- Since the simulation won't be able to take all variables into control, it may have a bias towards one answer\n"
