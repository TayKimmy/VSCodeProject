I then introduce the quiz by saying that the user will be asked 5 questions. For extra credit, I used lists and iterations to make a question list and an answer list. Then I used index (i) to make it so that if the user's answer was equal to the corresponding answer_list answer, then a correct answer response was given. If the answer that the user gave did not match the corresponding answer_list answer, then an incorrct answer response was given. I then also told the user how many correct answers they got out of the total amount of questions."
