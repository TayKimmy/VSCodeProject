    "Procedural Abstraction: Provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does\n",
    "- Have variable parameters\n",
    "- Code handles different situations depending on how its parameters are set/called\n",
    "- It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems.\n",

    "Why are procedures effective?: Have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program\n",
    "- Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code\n",
    "    - Able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc.\n",
    "    - Much better than reviewing code without a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line)"

    "### <mark>Homework/Hacks</mark>: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate \"APCSP\" into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. "
