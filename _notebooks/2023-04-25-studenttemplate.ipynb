    "All of the topics below are things that have been heavily covered and used throughout the class. We will mostly be focusing on more complicated uses and mechanics of these topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "- What are Lists?\n",
    "    - Lists are an ordered sequence of elements, where each element is a variable\n",
    "    - Unlike dictionaries, lists' keys are all integers that describe the order of the list\n",
    "    - Elements in a list can be accessed using index numbers\n",
    "    - Built in functions such as `len()`, `min()`, `max()`, and `sum()`\n",
    "    - Elements can be easily added and removed - `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, and `pop()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of lists:\n",
    "- Playlist of songs\n",
    "- names of students in a class\n",
    "- contacts on your phone\n",
    "- Grocery List\n",
    "- List of integers - maybe numbers of favorite soccer players\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each element of a string is referenced by an index (which is a number) and they generally start 0 but for the AP Exam it starts at 1.\n",
    "    - AP Exam: 1,2,3,4 etc.\n",
    "    - Python:  0,1,2,3 etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do lists Manage Complexity of a program?**\n",
    "- We may not need as many variables. For example:\n",
    "    - One Variable that holds all students would be better than having a variable for EACH student\n",
    "    - There can also be a list of test scores so if they need to be curved then the same calculation can be applied to the list (that has all the students) instead of doing the calculations one at a time\n",
    "- Related data can be grouped together\n",
    "- Lists can be iterated using a `for` loop, which enables multiple elements to be accessed\n",
    "- There are many built in functions for lists"

    "Lists are helpful because it helps manage complexity by making code easier to read and use. Using lists also help us to use built in functions that enable us to perform a task much more quickly. Collegeboard likes to use the word \"abstraction\" to describe the function of lists, as complex data structures are simplified."

    "- A procedure is a sequence of instructions that performs a specific task.\n",
