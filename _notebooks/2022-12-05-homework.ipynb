    "\n",
    "- Lists are collections of data\n",
    "- Lists are very helpful because you can use them to store unlimited amounts of data\n",
    "- Using loops and functions that locate list data using indexes, you can perform specific functions on lists\n",
    "- List indexes generally start with 0\n",
    "- Numbers in list can be used for math\n",
    "- Iteration is basically repetition\n",
    "- It is helpful to have code that repeat a function so that you don't have to copy-and-paste over and over again\n",
    "- A function generally iterates a certain number of times based on its purpose\n",
    "- For loops check the information stored within a list and use it as specified by the given variable\n",
    "- For loops are good for applying a certain alogrithm or function to an entire list of similar things\n",
    "- You can also use dictionaries to perform functions and make your code neater and more organized\n",
    "- Recursive loops involve incrementing a variable until it reaches a certain break point\n",
    "- While loops are very similar to recursive loops, but with a different syntax."
