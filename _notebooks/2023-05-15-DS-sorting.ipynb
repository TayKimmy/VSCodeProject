If the one on the right is smaller than the one on the left, I will switch the two, so here, I switch 75 and 17 since 17 is smaller than 75. I keep doing this until the list is sorted.\n",
    "Selection Sort: I will look at the biggest number and the smallest number in the list and then switch the 2 - 80 and 0. Then, I will look at the 2nd biggest and the 2nd smallest and switch - 79, 17. I keep doing this until the list is sorted.\n",

    "Insertion Sort: The process will be very similar to Bubble Sort except insertion will only iterate through the list once. It looks at 2 consecutive elements and switches them if the one on the right is smaller - 75 and 17. It also looks at the new consecutive elements after switching so that the whole list is sorted. For example, after switching 75 and 17, 75 is also bigger than 46 so the two are switched."
