    "Okay, so we've learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there's a more advanced program you don't know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user?\n",
    "\n",
    "Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement.\n",
    "Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word \"from\", followed by the package name, then the word \"import\", then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package's name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use \"*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word \"as\", and write the name you would like to use that package as.\n",
