    "> A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1), or constant time. \n"

    "## What is Hashing and Collision?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "> However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary.\n",

    "## Favorite Taylor Swift Song Seed\n",
    "My favorite Taylor Swift song is Love Story. Love Story is on many of my Spotify playlists that I listen to frequently because I like it so much. I first heard it in many Instagram edits and I loved the catchy tune. I was also reading Romeo and Juliet at the time, and I greatly appreciated the reference to the great romance tragedy classic by William Shakespeare. I also liked the theme of young romance and it helped me relate to it. A song of impossible fantasy. I also loved the melody and it was very easy to hum or sing along to. I also enjoyed Taylor Swift's singing in the song, which was soft yet powerful. She sang in way that made the lyrics stand out and enabled me to hear it clearly. I especially liked the parts where the dad says \"Stay Away from Juliet\" because it shows a kind of forbidden love. I also like the part \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\n",
    "\n",
    "I love you, and that's all I really know\n",
    "\n",
    "I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a love story, baby, just say yes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "because it shows a happy ending and this part of song is especially exciting. I just enjoyed the calmness of the song and this is one of the greatest songs ever."
