Notes of Gratitude . I made 2 notes of gratitudes, one to my friend on campus and one to my parents at home. For the note to my friend, I thanked him for staying with me for many years and helping me when I needed. I tried to express my gratitude sincerely and fully. He was very grateful for the note and that was that. For the note to my parents, I thanked them for helping me become who I am today. I expressed my gratitude for them and I also showed my appreciation for them doing many things for me (driving me, cooking for me, doing laundery, cleaning, etc.). They were also very grateful for my note and were proud of me. . . Gratitude List . These are the things that I am grateful for: . Access to daily food | A house | A good school | Many friends | Opportunity for education | Opportunity to do different sports | Having a lot clothing | Heating and air conditioning | Money | Having technology (i.e. phones, laptops, TV) | Access to supplies | Family that I can count on | Living in California | . .

Computing innovations . Effective collaboration produces innovations that reflect the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it | Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias when developing computing innovations | . . What are computing innovations . A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function | A computing innovation can be physical (self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (e-commerce). | . . Interpersonal Skills . Effective collaboration leads to the practice of interpersonal skills, such as: . Communication | Consensus Building | Conflict Resolution | Negotiation | . . Results of effective collaboration . Many major apps such as Facebook and Instagram were made through effective collaboration | Famous games such as Super Mario 2 and 3 were also made through effect collaboration | . Collaboration in AP CSP . Essential Knowledge . Consultation and communcation with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations | Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives | Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents | Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration | . . How to collaborate in class . Pair Programming . Two programmers work together as a pair. One (driver)writes program code, while the other (oberserver, pointer, navigator) reviews each line of program code | . Think-Pair-Share . Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class | . . Purpose of comments in code . Communicate to you partner(s) | Communicate to yourself | Acknowledge code segments used from other sources | Acknowledge media used from other sources | Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did | Clarify the functionality of your code | . . Online collaboration tools for class . Repl.it - multiplayer, multiple languages | GitHub - collaboration and repository | Shared document or folder - share code | . . Screenshot of Collegeboard quiz results . This is the screenshot showing that I completed the Collegeboard Collaboration quiz. . . . My Group Considerations . My group does consist of curent friends, but it is not strictly based on that. We do have common interests, interests in coding, interests in getting good grades, and interests in other hobbies. But, we do have separate interests and diverse personalities | My group has diverse backgrounds and perspectives, but not gender. Our group is all male, but we are differents races and ethnicities. We also have different perspectives due to these different backgrounds and different upbringings. | My group is very well equipped for the skill sets needed for success in the classroom. We work together collaboratively, we share ideas, we share mistakes in code, we talk about goals, and we are also kind to each other. | .",

Save notes in the website and the alogrithm uses the notes to genrate questions for a quiz. The quiz is then scored and the topics missied are highlighted* | . Collegeboard Requirements . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of the program is to randomly generate questions based on a user&#39;s notes of key terms/dates/ideas and definitions. The program will take the user&#39;s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the quiz. . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user&#39;s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. .",

For Loops and Index . Using for loops and iterating through using index in python. In this simple example, I created a list of car brands and then I used a for loop to iterate through it. Then, I printed all the values that I iterated through. . Car_Brands = [&quot;Honda&quot;, &quot;Hyundai&quot;, &quot;Kia&quot;, &quot;Tesla&quot;, &quot;Lamborghini&quot;, &quot;Ferrari&quot;, &quot;Bugatti&quot;, &quot;Toyota&quot;, &quot;Porsche&quot;, &quot;Mustang&quot;, &quot;BMW&quot;, &quot;Mercedes&quot;] # Using a for loop to iterate through list for i in Car_Brands: print(i) # printing all the values . Honda Hyundai Kia Tesla Lamborghini Ferrari Bugatti Toyota Porsche Mustang BMW Mercedes . Outputting in Reverse Order . It is possible to output data in a reverse order. In this example, I determine if an inputted word is a palindrome. I first iterate through the inputted word the opposite way, or reverse order, and then if the reversed order is equal to the regular order, then I output that the word is a palindrome. If not, then I say the inputted word is not a palindrome. . def is_palindrome(prompt): print(prompt[::-1]) # iterates through the word in the reverse order print(prompt) return prompt[::-1] == prompt # returns if the reverse order is the same as the regular order word = input(&quot;Enter a word: &quot;) if is_palindrome(word.lower()) is True: # If the reverse is the same as regular print(&quot;{0} is a palindrome!&quot;.format(word)) else: print(&quot;The provided word is not a palindrome.&quot;) . eyb bye The provided word is not a palindrome. . Other list methods . Lists can have a variety of methods performed on them. A couple being .append() or while loop. In this example, I use .append() and .lower() with a for loop. I first make a list that I add dangerous animals. Then, I append another value. I made sure to make all the inputs have weird capitalization. Then, I terated through the range of the length of the list. I also made all the list values lowercase and then I printed all the values. . Dangerous_Animals = [&quot;Box Jellyfish&quot;, &quot;African CAPE BuFfalo&quot;, &quot;BLAck MambA&quot;, &quot;Blue-RINGED octopus&quot;] # made a list with dangerous animals, has weird capitalization Dangerous_Animals.append(&quot;Cone SnAIl&quot;) # added a new list value for i in range(len(Dangerous_Animals)): # iterates through the range of the length of the list Dangerous_Animals[i] = Dangerous_Animals[i].lower() # made all the values lowercase print(Dangerous_Animals) . [&#39;box jellyfish&#39;, &#39;african cape buffalo&#39;, &#39;black mamba&#39;, &#39;blue-ringed octopus&#39;, &#39;cone snail&#39;] . Using While Loop . While loops can also be used with a list. In this example, I used the same list as before. Then, I defined i as 0. Then I used a while loop so that while i was less than the length of the list, the output was equal to the list at index of i. I printed the output and I incremented i by 1 each time. . Dangerous_Animals = [&quot;Box Jellyfish&quot;, &quot;African Cape Buffalo&quot;, &quot;Black Mamba&quot;, &quot;Blue-ringed Octopus&quot;] # used the same list as before i = 0 # defined a variable, i while i &lt; len(Dangerous_Animals): # only runs while i is less than the length of the list output = Dangerous_Animals[i] # output equals each value when the list is at index of i print(output) i += 1 # increments i by 1 each time . Box Jellyfish African Cape Buffalo Black Mamba Blue-ringed Octopus . Adding to a Dictionary . You can also add or create new keys and values to a dictionary data set. This can also be done with input. In the example, I first created a dictionary with pokemon names as the keys and their type as values. I then added a new key and value and I also used input to add a new value and new key. . My_Dict = { &quot;Pikachu&quot;: &quot;Electric-type&quot;, &quot;Charizard&quot;: &quot;Fire-type&quot;, &quot;Blastoise&quot;: &quot;Water-type&quot;, &quot;Venusaur&quot;: &quot;Grass-type&quot;, &quot;Snorlax&quot;: &quot;Normal-type&quot;, &quot;Garchomp&quot;: &quot;Dragon-type&quot;, &quot;Lucario&quot;: &quot;Fighting-type&quot;, &quot;Darkrai&quot;: &quot;Dark-type&quot;, &quot;Arceus&quot;: &quot;Normal-type&quot;, } # defined a new dictionary print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Reshiram&quot;] = &quot;Dragon-type&quot; #Added new key and value into dictionary print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Articuno&quot;] = input() # Added new value with input print(My_Dict) . {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;} {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Reshiram&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;} {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Reshiram&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Articuno&#39;: &#39;Ice-type&#39;} . Python Quiz . I made a quiz using the InfoDb, list of dictionary. In this example, I defined a function with prompt as a parameter. I also defined a variable word, so that it was equal to the user&#39;s input. I also added 2 new variables, that defined the number of correct answers and the number of questions. I then printed a short intro that said &quot;Hello, you will be asked (the amount of questions) short questions.&quot; I then made a list of dictionaries (InfoDb) with the questions as the keys and the answers as the values. I then used a for loop to iterate through all the dictionary keys and values. If the word (user&#39;s input) for each question was equal to its respectable answer, then it printed &quot;Answer is correct&quot; and added the number of correct answers by 1. If the word wasn&#39;t equal, then an incorrect answer resopnse was pinted. At the end, I printed the amount of questions the user got correct out of the total questions. . def Python_Quiz(prompt): # Defines function that takes &#39;prompt&#39; as a parameter global word # so that word can be called outside function print (&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) # setup for each question word = input() # the variable word is the user&#39;s input return word questions_number = 5 correct_answer = 0 # 2 variables for the number of questions and number of correct answers print(&quot;Hello, you will be asked &quot; + str(questions_number) + &quot; short questions&quot;) # short intro My_Quiz = [{ &quot;What is the answer to this math problem: What is f(4) if f(x) = 3x/x-3&quot;: &quot;12&quot;, &quot;What is the most popular religion in the world?&quot;: &quot;Christianity&quot;, &quot;What is the capital of the U.S?&quot;: &quot;Washington D.C.&quot;, &quot;What is the molar mass of Carbon-12?&quot;: &quot;12 g&quot;, &quot;How many moles of water are in a 3.0 gram sample?&quot;: &quot;0.17&quot;, }] # makes a list of dictionaries with questions as the keys and the answers as the values for dict in My_Quiz: # for all dictionary stuff in the InfoDb for questions, answers in dict.items(): # both keys and values Python_Quiz(questions) # the prompt is the questions if word == answers: # if the user&#39;s answer is equal to the correct answer print(&quot;Answer is correct&quot;) correct_answer += 1 else: print(&quot;Answer is incorrect&quot;) print(&quot;You scored &quot; + str(correct_answer) + &quot;/&quot; + str(questions_number)) # prints how many correct answers out of total questions .

Answer is correct Question: How many moles of water are in a 3.0 gram sample? Answer is correct You scored 4/5 . Explanation . Inside the function: I defined the function Python_Quiz, I made a variable &quot;word&quot; and I also made it so that every question started with the format &quot;Question:&quot;. I defined the variable &quot;word&quot; so that it was equal to the input of the user. I also made the variable global so that it could be called outside of the function. . Outside the function: I made 2 new variables &quot;questions&quot;, and &quot;correct_answer&quot; which is later used to say the amount of question and correct answers. I then introduce the quiz by saying that the user will be asked 5 questions. For extra credit, I used lists and iterations to make a question list and an answer list. Then I used index (i) to make it so that if the user&#39;s answer was equal to the corresponding answer_list answer, then a correct answer response was given. If the answer that the user gave did not match the corresponding answer_list answer, then an incorrct answer response was given. I then also told the user how many correct answers they got out of the total amount of questions. .",

Artemia (brine shrimp) is a genus of very small anostracan crustaceans found in saline habitats. They are distantly related to a number of other small to microscopic crustaceans - Triops (Notostraca), water fleas (Cladocera), and clam shrimp (‘Conchostraca’). . Description . Artemia and other Anostraca are generally elongated, with an anatomy somewhat ‘generic’ among crustaceans, though they have only 1 pair of well-developed antennae. . | They utilize 11 pairs of thoracic legs and a set of ‘flukes’ on their tails to swim, which they do upside-down. . | To feed, they may scrape organic material from available surfaces or filter particles from the water. . | . Common food source for birds, certain insects, fishes, and larger crustaceans . | Maximum length of just over 1cm . | Healthiest food for them is the microscopic algae Dunaliella viridis . | As passive filter feeders, brine shrimp collect whatever is in the water and sweep it into their mouths . | Brine shrimp may become dormant in cysts in order to resist extreme environmental conditions until the environment becomes more favorable. . | . Life Cycle . Brine shrimp start out as cysts until the water warms, after which they become larvae (nauplii) . These cysts may remain dormant for as long as 25 years. . | . | Brine shrimp make new exoskeletons and molt old ones at various stages of growth . | It may take 8 days for brine shrimp to mature under ideal conditions, and around 3-6 weeks under natural conditions . | Females release different offspring under different conditions. If conditions are favorable, they release eggs that develop immediately into larvae, and if conditions are unfavorable, they release cysts. . | . Habitat &amp; Conditions: . Found in saline inland bodies of water, including salt swamps, lakes, and evaporation ponds, but never in the open ocean . | Able to live in salinity ranging from 2.9% to 50% . | Thrives in water temperatures of 6 to 37 degrees celsius, optimal reproduction temperature at 25 degrees celsius . | The salinity of water affects the types of microbes that are available from them to eat . | . Other facts: . Often found swimming “upside-down” with appendages facing upwards due to positive phototaxis . Often rise to the surface of the water during the day and sink at night . | . | Brine shrimp color may be affected by diet and the environment. . | Brine shrimps are often used to test the toxicity of certain substances. . | .

As a result of this experiment/investigation, what modifications or changes could be made to improve the procedure? . Changes that can be made to improve the procedure include collecting data until all shrimp die and all leftover eggs hatch (with the shrimp living their entire life cycles). In addition, a specific molarity of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) may be added to each petri dish for precision. . | . . Introduction . The survival of organisms in the wild is often affected by various environmental abiotic factors. In the case of the anostracan Artemia salina, these include a water temperature of 25°C, a pH of 8.1, minimal water movement, &lt;20 mPa of pressure and high (≤50%) salinity. A. salina is generally found at low depths and presumably requires relatively high oxygen levels and normal light/dark cycling. A. salina is highly vulnerable to poisoning by metallic elements and all life stages are killed by ionizing radiation. . Problem . What will be the effect of different acidity levels within the surrounding environment on the development of the brine shrimp? . Hypothesis and Experimental Setup . This experiment investigated the effects of modulating pH on A. salina nauplii survival rates. The null hypothesis is: “Addition of sulfuric acid to water will not affect the proportion of surviving brine shrimp.” The alternative hypothesis is: “If sulfuric acid is added to water to make it more acidic, then the proportion of brine shrimp that survive over the course of the experiment will decrease.” . There were three petri dishes making up three experimental groups. Each petri dish was filled with saltwater with brine shrimp. The groups are as follows: a control group in which no acid was added to the saltwater, a treatment group with a water pH of 7, and a treatment group with a water pH of 6. Sulfuric acid was added to the treatment groups to decrease pH, and as such, the amount of pH was the independent variable. During the experiment, the number of brine shrimp dead and alive was measured over 24-hour intervals to reflect a dependent variable of brine shrimp viability . Materials and Procedures . To conduct an experiment to test these hypotheses, the following materials were gathered: . Salt based water (50 mL) in a large container . | 3 Petri Dishes . | Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) . | Brine Shrimp . | Sharpies . | Masking tape . | Three 50 mL beakers . | 10 mL graduated cylinder . | Pipette . | Shoebin with brine shrimp and salt-based water . | Light source . | . Using these materials, the following procedure was followed: . 1) &gt; 3 petri dishes were labeled with masking tape and a sharpie as “Control pH = 8”, ‘“Experimental group #1 pH = 7”, and “Experimental group #2 pH = 6”. The appropriate identification of all three petri dishes was also labeled(in this case, Table 5 Period 4) . 2) &gt; A 50 mL beaker was used to scoop saltwater out of a larger container. 30 mL of saltwater was measured out using the 10 mL graduated cylinder and added to each petri dish. . 3) &gt; Sulfuric acid was added to each petri dish until the pH of the two treatment groups were in correspondence with their assigned labels. . 4) &gt; A 50 mL beaker was used to scoop from the shoebin with brine shrimp, and was exposed to light. . 5) &gt; A pipette was used to transfer brine shrimp from the beaker into another beaker to reduce the volume of eggs. . 6) &gt; A pipette was used to squirt brine shrimp into each petri dish from the container. . 7) &gt; The number in each petri dish of brine shrimp was counted and recorded; a light on each petri dish while counting to clearly see the shrimp. Record this in the data table. . 8) &gt; Return to the petri dishes 24 hours and 48 hours after they were set up. Count the number of live and dead brine shrimp in each petri dish; shine a light on each petri dish while counting to clearly see the shrimp. . Constants . It is important to ensure only the independent variable changes during an experiment, in this case, the pH of water in each petri dish. All other variables must be controlled. Some constants include the water temperature, which remained constant as the petri dishes were kept within an air-conditioned classroom and stored in the same shelf when not in use. In addition, the time intervals between the groups were kept consistent; this includes the time of day each experimental group was set up and the time of day data was collected from each group (both of which were either near 12:00 or 12:30), as well as the length of time that data was collected (over two days). Finally, the salinity of the water in each petri dish was kept constant, given that the water was derived from the same two containers (one with saltwater and one with brine shrimp). . Data . Table 1: Brine Shrimp Viability .     0 hours   24 hours   48 hours   . Dish # | pH | Alive | Dead | Alive | Dead | Alive | Dead | . 1 | 8 | 10 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 12 | 2 | . 2 | 7 | 11 | 0 | 18 | 2 | 9 | 4 | . 3 | 6 | 10 | 0 | 17 | 1 | 17 | 3 | . . Discussion and Conclusions . Conclusive results cannot be drawn due to a number of confounding factors. Some of these include brine shrimp eggs that were placed in the petri dishes along with the live brine shrimp. A number of eggs hatched during the period between the first two data collections, resulting in an increase in the number of brine shrimp in each setup. In addition, some individuals observed during the second data collection were not found, alive or dead, in the third (one in the control and 7 in the pH 7 setup). All data collection was done manually in periods of 5 minutes each, likely resulting in random error. . If a future experiment were conducted, more accurate results can be achieved by implementing an automatic counting system and extracting only hatched brine shrimp from the original holding container. A repetition of the experiment with the changes made above would be helpful in taking data leading to conclusive results. Consideration of further research avenues may proceed following the procurement of genuine results. . Works Cited . Artemia salina, https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Artemia_salina/.
