The loop never ends because the loop can only end when a variable equals 4. But, each time, as the variable is increased by 1, the loop defines the variable as 1 in the beginning. This causes the loop to keep going. | . 30 | I got this question wrong because I didn’t fully understand the code segment or the function. I also didn’t look carefully at the order of the code, which led to the incorrect answer. | . 42 | I got this answer wrong because I didn’t fully understand computer simulations. I didn’t realize that they could be used to present designs to customers, I only thought that they were used within companies. | . 45 | I didn’t fully understand the definition of a heuristic approach. I thought they were only used when the problem could be solved in a reasonable time, but they actually should be used when the problem cannot be solved in reasonable time. | . 47 | I also missed this problem because I didn’t really understand heuristic approaches and its uses. I thought its best used for simple problems, so I thought that a program that sorts numbers in order was good for heuristic approach. In reality, finding the shortest driving route between two locations was the best program to use a heuristic approach. | . 50 | I missed this question because I didn’t know how to convert hexadecimal to decimal. I knew that hexadecimal mean base 16, but I could’t convert hexadecimal 56 into decimal. | . Ultimately, I missed questions near the end because my focus dwindled and I wasn’t able to fully read the question properly. .",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": "Notes . 3.14 . (Fill in the blank) . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . 3.15 . Random Values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring . Each Result from randomization is equally likely to occur Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result . Examples: . Dice | Marbles | . Used in coding: . Games | Statistical Sampling | Cryptography | . 3.14 Libraries Challenges and Homework . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | Import the package as a more convenient name. | import math x = math.factorial(8) print(x) . 40320 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a __ to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. . Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Screenshots . Challenge 3: Math . Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! | . import math x = int(input(&quot;Choose a number&quot;)) y = int(input(&quot;Choose a second number&quot;)) print(math.ceil(x)) print(math.ceil(y)) print(math.floor(x)) print(math.floor(y)) print(math.lcm(x,y)) print(math.gcd(x,y)) print(math.factorial(x)) print(math.factorial(y)) print(math.nextafter(x,y)) . 3 4 3 4 12 1 6 24 3.0000000000000004 . Homework - Libraries . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . Screenshots . 3.15 - Random Values Challenges and Homework . Challenge 1 . Write a function that will a simulate a coinflip and print the output EXTRA: Create a function that will randomly select 5 playing Cards and check if the 5 cards are a Royal Flush . import random def coinflip(): x = &quot;&quot; for i in range(4): flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: x = &quot;Heads&quot; elif flip == 2: x = &quot;Tails&quot; print(&quot;Flip #&quot;, i+1, &quot;:&quot;, x) coinflip() . Flip # 1 : Heads Flip # 2 : Tails Flip # 3 : Heads Flip # 4 : Tails . Homework - Random Values . Given a random decimal number, convert it into binary. If you would like an opportunity for extra points, find a way to convert it into hexadecimal as well. . import random x = random.randint(1, 50) c = bin(x) y = hex(int(c.replace(&quot;0b&quot;,&quot;0&quot;))) print(&quot;The binary of&quot;, x, &quot;is:&quot;, int(c.replace(&quot;0b&quot;, &quot;0&quot;))) print(&quot;The hexadecimal of&quot;, x, &quot;is:&quot;, y) .",

What are some other names for procedures?: Another name for procedures are function. Procedure names can be any name we want, i.e. decimalToBinary() . Why are procedures effective?: Have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program .

            "content": "To define a variable in python, just type in the variable name - one word - and use the = sign to set it equal to it&#39;s value. A variable can be defined using numbers, string, list, or boolean. Strings must have quotations around it and lists must be surrounded by square brackets. Once you have defined a variable, you can do many functions and conditions with it, including the print() statement. . #defining all the variables using the equal sign numbervariable = 25 stringvariable = &quot;word&quot; numberlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] stringlist = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;] israining = False #printing all the defined variables print(numbervariable) print(stringvariable) print(numberlist) print(stringlist) print(israining) . 25 word [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;] False . Once a variable is defined using a numerical value, mathematical expressions can also be performed on the variable. . number = 5 #defining the variable number x = number * 2 #defining a variable by using another variable print(number*2) # multiplying a variable by 2 print(x) . 10 10 . Once a list is defined, many functions can be performed, such as the append() function. . list = [] list.append(&quot;cookies&quot;) # appending a value to a defined list print(list) . [&#39;cookies&#39;] . A dictionary can also be defined using curly brackets and the equal sign. To input keys and values into a dictionary, you have to use a slightly different approach than lists. . mydict = {&quot;ice cream&quot;:&quot;dairy&quot;} # defining dictionary using curly brackets mydict[&quot;banana&quot;] = &quot;fruit&quot; #add keys and values to a dict by setting a value equal to a key, like shown mydict[&quot;ice cream&quot;] = &quot;dessert&quot; #editing a value inside the dictionary print(mydict) . {&#39;ice cream&#39;: &#39;dessert&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;: &#39;fruit&#39;} . You can also interchange variables by using a temporary variable. In the code below, temp is the temporary variables, and var 1 and var 2 will have their values swapped. This code also works with integers, not just strings. . var1 = &quot;word&quot; # defining first variable var2 = &quot;number&quot; # defining second variable temp = var1 # defining temporary variable using the first variable var1 = var2 # changing the first variable value as the second variable value var2 = temp # changing the second variable value to the first variable value . Variables can also be defined using float data types, instead of just int types, but are used the exact same way. The same mathematical functions also apply. . number = 20.3 #defining a variable usinbg float x = number/10 #defining second variable y = number*2 # defining third variable print(number) # printing first variable print(x) #printing second variable print(y) # printing third variable print(x*y) #printing the second and third variables multiplied . 20.3 2.0300000000000002 40.6 82.418 . The function below takes in a parameter, x, and determines if x is even or odd. Variables can be used within functions to perform a certain task, which in this case, is to determine even or odd. To define a function, use the variable def and use a colon. Make sure there are parenthesis next to the function name, even if the function doesn&#39;t tkae in any parameters. . def IsEven(x): # define the function if x % 2 == 0: # % variable returns the remainder of division # use double equal signs when determining if a value is equal to another value return True if x % 2 != 0: # the != means not equal to return False #printing the values outputted by the function multiple times print(IsEven(24)) print(IsEven(7)) print(IsEven(19)) print(IsEven(30)) .

            "content": ". Questions . A lot of the questions consisted of those on collaboration and its benefits. It also asked questions about the Internet, such as protocols and data transmissions. There were also many questions that gave a block of code and asked for the result or an error in the code. A few problems even described programs and asked potential errors, inputs, outputs, and uses. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Most of these questions were fairly straightforward, but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking. . . What I missed . I missed 7 questions. Most of these were due to silly mistakes. For example, the question asked to choose 2 answers but I only chose 1. I also missed 1 or 2 questions because I forgot some information about the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output. . Question #13: This question showed a block of code that received a list of numbers as a parameter, and returned true if all the numbers were positive. I got this question wrong because I didn’t look at the code carefully. The code only returns false if all the numbers are negative or 0 because of the order of the if statements. I didn’t notice this and I chose the wrong answer. . Question #17: This question tested knowledge on internet protocols. It asked what the use of open protocols were on the Internet. I got this wrong because I didn’t study internet protocols and I forgot what they were and used for. . Question #19: This question tested knowledge on binary sequences. It asked if a 4-bit sequence could add the values 14 and 15 and assign a sum of 29. I did do the adding and binary correctly, and I figured out that a 4-bit sequence could hold the values 14 and 15. Because of this, I said that a 4-bit sequence could be used to perform this function. I didn’t think of the actual sum of 29. A 4-bit sequence couldn’t hold the value 29, but I didn’t think of this and I got the wrong answer. . Question #21: This question tested knowledge on binary and it’s uses. It asked whether binary could be used to represent strings of characters, colors, audio recordings. I didn’t know that binary sequences could be used to represent audio recordings, so I chose the wrong answer. . Question #35: This question gave blocks of code as answer choices and asked which ones performed a specfic function. If the value of a variable of was greater than 120, another variable would be valued as 30, while if the other variable was less than 120, than the variable would be valued as 50. I did get the right answer, but I didn’t see that the question asked for 2 answers. I got this wrong because I only chose one correct answer. . Question #37: This question gave blocks of code as answer choices and asked which one interchanged the values of two different variables. I chose the wrong code because a temporary variable is needed to interchange the values, but I forgot about this fact. . Question #39: This question asked which answer choice was a valid index for the list. I chose -1, because I thought that negative indexes existed. It turns out that list indices are generally nonnegative integers. . . What I can do better . Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing. I also have to remember to study some of the AP CSP materials, mainly those about the Internet, including protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data trannsmissions and algorithms. . . Results . Here is a screenshot of the results of my Trimester 1 Final on Collegeboard. .",

Classes include 3D Animation, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, CSP, CSA, and more. In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best artpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks. . . 3D Animation . Here are a few screenshots of artworks in 3D Animation. As I have already taken this course, I know how the class works and what the curriculum is. But, I still get exposed to new ideas and creative inventions. . . AP/Studio Art . Here are a few screenshots of artworks in Studio Art. I have never been the best at drawing, so I was fascinated by how the artists managed to make their artwork look realistic, and used shading to create a sense of three-dimensional space. . . Ceramics . Here is a screenshot of artworks in Ceramics. I have never even done Ceramics before, so I have no idea how students mold their clay and then dry them into a sculpture as shown above. .",

We also made wireframes using Canva to plan out our project and also design our website before actually making it. It helped prevent errors and problems by fixing and thinking everything through beforehand. We designed all our pages through the wireframme before coding for it in VSCode. . . Problems . We did run into a few problems while making our final project. . One of our problems was formatting the website’s background We had to make it so that the aspect ratio was applicable to any screen size | Some computers showed the background being cut off | . | Another problem we had was getting our API to work At first, we couldn’t extract the questions from our URL and we couldn’t access the JSON file | After we figured that out, we couldn’t figure out how to call the backend code for API in the frontend We have not yet figured this out but we are working on connecting our API to our frontend | . | . | . . Progress . We have made considerable progress in our final project. . This first screenshot shows the homepage for our final project website, named Practice Nexus. We have cards for our two quizzes, a math quiz and a geography quiz. The page is also designed with different colors and images, with a navigation bar to access different parts of the website. . . This second screenshot shows the about us page for our final project website. The page introduces all the team members with the following information: . Role - Scrum Master, Frontend, Backend, DevOps | Age/Grade | Favorite things to do | Link to fastpages | . . We stil have to finish up some designing, as well as implementing our API into frontend. Once we do that, we also have to design each individual quiz page so that one question pops up at a time and answer choices can be selected. We might also include a scoring page, where we keep track of how many questions the user got right/wrong. . We plan to finish this by our design by splitting up the work while also keeping track of everyone else’s work and posting any problems/issues. Backend developers - Me and Luke - will work on coding for scores and also make/use API to get the questions into the Frontend | Frontend developers - Adi and Arnav - will implement the API and use it to get questions into the quiz pages. They will also design all the pages | Since backend doesn’t have as much work, backend developers will also help design and plan out the pages for the quizzes | . | . . Commits .

            "content": "Computer Systems and Network Diagram: . Computer Networks and Systems . A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Computers | Tablets | Servers | Routers | Smart sensors | . | A computer network is a type of computing system | A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a reciever) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver. | Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver. | The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. | Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second. | . . How Computers Are Connected . A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose. | A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. | . . Packets . A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information. | Packet Switching: The message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device. Ex: Hello. How are you? ==&gt; | Hello. You? How are | . | . | . . The Internet . The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonpropritary) communication protocols. | Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connact a computing dvice to an internet connected device. | Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance | Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets | Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly | Packets may arrive at the destination in order, our of order, or not at all | The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files | The World Wide Web uses the Internet | . . Protocols . A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system. | The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet. | IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet TCP does error checking and error recovery so it is slower | UDP performs error checking, but it discards erroneous packets | . | HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web | . . Internet and Transport Layers . Transport Layer - How the packets are sent, and for what Reliability - reliable - sender gets a receipt back, resend as needed TCP | Unreliability - send and forget. UDP | . | Internet Layer IPv4: Example 192.168.24.1 32 bits, separated into 4 “octets” 8 bits long (0-255) | Separated into 2 parts: Network (1-31) | Device (32-network bits) | . | . | Three targets that can be addressed using IP Unicast - A specific device. Internet wide access. TCP is used. | Multicast - A group of devices. It is specific range of IP addresses. Internet-wide access. UDP is used. | Broadcast - All devices. LAN-wide. Data stops at the router. UDP is used. | . | . . Application Layer . Key protocols used: http. How to ask and receive data from web servers. Normally uses TCP, Port 80 at the transport layer | https. Like http but with security. Usually uses TCP Port 443 | . | Web Servers: Programs running on machines connected to the Internet | Provides clients web pages - data linked to other pages using URLs (Uniform Resource Locations) | Ex, https://www.mycompany.com | The World Wide Web (WWW) is this network of linked data and programs, running over the Internet | . | DNS - Domain Name Service Applications that translate a human readable URL (e.g. www.mycompany.com) to an IP address | DNS holds a database of mapping of names to IPs. Servers running DNS are spread across the internet | There are large computers serving and managing these name/IP Mappings for each Domain (.com, .net, .gov, etc.) | You use a DNS server every time you ask for a web page on a browser | . | . . Scalibility of the Internet . The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands. | The Internet was designed to be scalable Able to change in size and scale to meet new demands | . | Local Area Network (LAN): Physical Connections | Limited by hardware and physics | 1 to 100s of systems | . | Intranet: LANs connected by Routers within an organization | . | Autonomous Systems (AS): Large intranets linked together under the control and policies of major organizations. Large routers link networks with large telecommunications connections | . | The Internet: Autonomous Systems linked together | Large Routers linking Ass via special telecom means (Fiber, T3, Satellites) | Major infrastructures - DNS (.com, .net, etc.), Cyber Operations | . | . . Authentication . Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access. Ex: Strong passwords | Multifactor authentication. | . | A strong passwrod is something that is easy for a user to remember, but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. | Multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know) | possession (something they have) | ingerence (something they are) | . | Multifactor authentication requires a least two steps to unlock protected information; each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain unauthorized access. | . . Encryption . Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access | Decryption: the process of decoding the data. | Two common encryption approaches are: Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption | Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver’s private key is required to decrypt the message | . | . | Certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validates the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model. | . . Viruses and Malware . Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection. | A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer. | Malware is software intended to damage a computing system or to take partial control over its operation. Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attachign itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment | . | Virus scans can help to prevent malicious code from getting into and affecting your system | . . Prevention . All real-world systems have errors or design flaws that can be exploited to compromise them. Regular software updates help fix errors that could compromise a computing system. | Users can control the permissions programs they have for collecting user information. Users should review the permission settings of programs to protect their privacy. | . . Quiz Results . .",

What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times for t, k in menu.items(): item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) if item == &quot;break&quot;: break total = total + menu[item] print(&quot;Total is: $&quot; + str(total)) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user .

Some errors that might arise in our project are: Our notes don&#39;t save | Only one note saves at a time | Storing notes/inputs for a specific user | . | Some test cases that can be used are testing user input and/or how output is displayed. We can also put in random notes and see if the questions that appear are relevant to the notes. We can also check if the answers are correct to their respective question. | We will document any bugs we encounter on our scrum board and/or slack. We can also put possible solutions on them as well. | Some single tests are putting in a random note on a random subject and checking that the note is saved, and the questions and answers are correct and relevant. |",

The following phrases are commonly used when developing a program: Investigating and refleting | Designing | Prototyping | Testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of the process. | A development proess that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: Collecting data through surveys | User testing | Inteviews | Direct observations | . | Program requirements describes how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide | . . How is a Program Developed? . Rarely a solo endeavor . Usually developed by teams of people It all starts with an idea | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect | . | Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: Determine the requirements of the program | Understand the constraints | Understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate?

Me and my team reviewed over the different possible final project ideas that we made and this is the best one we came up with. . . Outline and how it fits requirements . Program Purpose and Function -The purpose of the program is to randomly generate questions based on a user’s notes of key terms/dates/ideas and definitions. The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the quiz. | . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. | . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. | . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. | . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user’s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. | . .

PBL - Project Based Learning is an inquiry-based instructional approach, in a real-world context, where students generate the pathways and products that meet defined, standards-based outcomes | Project - Time frame in which your culminating product is developed through workshops and deliverables | Culminating Project - Compilation of deliverables derived from the Deconstructed TEKS that come together to create a final presentation/demonstration of what was learned throughout the project | Driving Questions - Helps to initiate and focus the inquiry. It also captures and communicates the purpose of the project in a succinct question. It creates interest and a feeling of challenge. It guides the project work. It helps student answer the question: “Why are we doing this?” | Enduring Understanding - Refers to the important ideas or CORE processes that are central to a discipline and transferable to new situations and that have lasting value BEYOND the classroom… Learning should be measured in YEARS. “30 hours vs. 30 days vs. 30 years” | Entry Launch - The engaging activity that kickstarts your PBL. | Entry Document - The document used to drive the project, connect the TEKS to the idea, and develop the KNOW/K2K. Can be delivered in multiple formats. | Checkpoints - Scheduled mini-presentations held throughout the project to allow for formative assessment, positive &amp; negative feedback, whole group collaboration, accountability, speaking practice, and progression toward project completion. These develop 21st Century Skills and reinforce the focus on the enduring understanding, driving question, and culminating product. | Facilitating Questions - Appropriate way that teachers use to guide students toward the enduring understanding/deliverable/goal, redirect students, “pull out” content vocabulary, or help students make connections (conceptual, cross-discipline, relevance, value). Open ended is most effective, but close ended, probing techniques are acceptable for scaffolding. | Workshops - Planned lessons that are listed for students in a checklist or added assessments indicate. Commonly held in small groups to meet the need of the student(s) or group(s). | Deliverable - “End result” or goal of a workshop that will directly be used for the realization of the culminating product. It can be knowledge, but it is typically something that will be presented, built upon, or used to achieve the project’s desired result. | .",

Save notes in the website and the alogrithm uses the notes to genrate questions for a quiz. The quiz is then scored and the topics missed are highlighted | . Collegeboard Requirements . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of the program is to randomly generate questions based on a user&#39;s notes of key terms/dates/ideas and definitions. The program will take the user&#39;s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the quiz. . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user&#39;s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. .",

For Loops and Index . Using for loops and iterating through using index in python. In this simple example, I created a list of car brands and then I used a for loop to iterate through it. Then, I printed all the values that I iterated through. . Car_Brands = [&quot;Honda&quot;, &quot;Hyundai&quot;, &quot;Kia&quot;, &quot;Tesla&quot;, &quot;Lamborghini&quot;, &quot;Ferrari&quot;, &quot;Bugatti&quot;, &quot;Toyota&quot;, &quot;Porsche&quot;, &quot;Mustang&quot;, &quot;BMW&quot;, &quot;Mercedes&quot;] # Using a for loop to iterate through list for i in Car_Brands: print(i) # printing all the values . Honda Hyundai Kia Tesla Lamborghini Ferrari Bugatti Toyota Porsche Mustang BMW Mercedes . Outputting in Reverse Order . It is possible to output data in a reverse order. In this example, I determine if an inputted word is a palindrome. I first iterate through the inputted word the opposite way, or reverse order, and then if the reversed order is equal to the regular order, then I output that the word is a palindrome. If not, then I say the inputted word is not a palindrome. . def is_palindrome(prompt): print(prompt[::-1]) # iterates through the word in the reverse order print(prompt) return prompt[::-1] == prompt # returns if the reverse order is the same as the regular order word = input(&quot;Enter a word: &quot;) if is_palindrome(word.lower()) is True: # If the reverse is the same as regular print(&quot;{0} is a palindrome!&quot;.format(word)) else: print(&quot;The provided word is not a palindrome.&quot;) . eyb bye The provided word is not a palindrome. . Other list methods . Lists can have a variety of methods performed on them. A couple being .append() or while loop. In this example, I use .append() and .lower() with a for loop. I first make a list that I add dangerous animals. Then, I append another value. I made sure to make all the inputs have weird capitalization. Then, I terated through the range of the length of the list. I also made all the list values lowercase and then I printed all the values. . Dangerous_Animals = [&quot;Box Jellyfish&quot;, &quot;African CAPE BuFfalo&quot;, &quot;BLAck MambA&quot;, &quot;Blue-RINGED octopus&quot;] # made a list with dangerous animals, has weird capitalization Dangerous_Animals.append(&quot;Cone SnAIl&quot;) # added a new list value for i in range(len(Dangerous_Animals)): # iterates through the range of the length of the list Dangerous_Animals[i] = Dangerous_Animals[i].lower() # made all the values lowercase print(Dangerous_Animals) . [&#39;box jellyfish&#39;, &#39;african cape buffalo&#39;, &#39;black mamba&#39;, &#39;blue-ringed octopus&#39;, &#39;cone snail&#39;] . Using While Loop . While loops can also be used with a list. In this example, I used the same list as before. Then, I defined i as 0. Then I used a while loop so that while i was less than the length of the list, the output was equal to the list at index of i. I printed the output and I incremented i by 1 each time. . Dangerous_Animals = [&quot;Box Jellyfish&quot;, &quot;African Cape Buffalo&quot;, &quot;Black Mamba&quot;, &quot;Blue-ringed Octopus&quot;] # used the same list as before i = 0 # defined a variable, i while i &lt; len(Dangerous_Animals): # only runs while i is less than the length of the list output = Dangerous_Animals[i] # output equals each value when the list is at index of i print(output) i += 1 # increments i by 1 each time . Box Jellyfish African Cape Buffalo Black Mamba Blue-ringed Octopus . Adding to a Dictionary . You can also add or create new keys and values to a dictionary data set. This can also be done with input. In the example, I first created a dictionary with pokemon names as the keys and their type as values. I then added a new key and value and I also used input to add a new value and new key. . My_Dict = { &quot;Pikachu&quot;: &quot;Electric-type&quot;, &quot;Charizard&quot;: &quot;Fire-type&quot;, &quot;Blastoise&quot;: &quot;Water-type&quot;, &quot;Venusaur&quot;: &quot;Grass-type&quot;, &quot;Snorlax&quot;: &quot;Normal-type&quot;, &quot;Garchomp&quot;: &quot;Dragon-type&quot;, &quot;Lucario&quot;: &quot;Fighting-type&quot;, &quot;Darkrai&quot;: &quot;Dark-type&quot;, &quot;Arceus&quot;: &quot;Normal-type&quot;, } # defined a new dictionary print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Reshiram&quot;] = &quot;Dragon-type&quot; #Added new key and value into dictionary print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Articuno&quot;] = input() # Added new value with input print(My_Dict) . {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;} {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Reshiram&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;} {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Reshiram&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Articuno&#39;: &#39;Ice-type&#39;} . Python Quiz . I made a quiz using the InfoDb, list of dictionary. In this example, I defined a function with prompt as a parameter. I also defined a variable word, so that it was equal to the user&#39;s input. I also added 2 new variables, that defined the number of correct answers and the number of questions. I then printed a short intro that said &quot;Hello, you will be asked (the amount of questions) short questions.&quot; I then made a list of dictionaries (InfoDb) with the questions as the keys and the answers as the values. I then used a for loop to iterate through all the dictionary keys and values. If the word (user&#39;s input) for each question was equal to its respectable answer, then it printed &quot;Answer is correct&quot; and added the number of correct answers by 1. If the word wasn&#39;t equal, then an incorrect answer resopnse was pinted. At the end, I printed the amount of questions the user got correct out of the total questions. . def Python_Quiz(prompt): # Defines function that takes &#39;prompt&#39; as a parameter global word # so that word can be called outside function print (&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) # setup for each question word = input() # the variable word is the user&#39;s input return word questions_number = 5 correct_answer = 0 # 2 variables for the number of questions and number of correct answers print(&quot;Hello, you will be asked &quot; + str(questions_number) + &quot; short questions&quot;) # short intro My_Quiz = [{ &quot;What is the answer to this math problem: What is f(4) if f(x) = 3x/x-3&quot;: &quot;12&quot;, &quot;What is the most popular religion in the world?&quot;: &quot;Christianity&quot;, &quot;What is the capital of the U.S?&quot;: &quot;Washington D.C.&quot;, &quot;What is the molar mass of Carbon-12?&quot;: &quot;12 g&quot;, &quot;How many moles of water are in a 3.0 gram sample?&quot;: &quot;0.17&quot;, }] # makes a list of dictionaries with questions as the keys and the answers as the values for dict in My_Quiz: # for all dictionary stuff in the InfoDb for questions, answers in dict.items(): # both keys and values Python_Quiz(questions) # the prompt is the questions if word == answers: # if the user&#39;s answer is equal to the correct answer print(&quot;Answer is correct&quot;) correct_answer += 1 else: print(&quot;Answer is incorrect&quot;) print(&quot;You scored &quot; + str(correct_answer) + &quot;/&quot; + str(questions_number)) # prints how many correct answers out of total questions .

Answer is correct Question: How many moles of water are in a 3.0 gram sample? Answer is correct You scored 4/5 . Explanation . Inside the function: I defined the function Python_Quiz, I made a variable &quot;word&quot; and I also made it so that every question started with the format &quot;Question:&quot;. I defined the variable &quot;word&quot; so that it was equal to the input of the user. I also made the variable global so that it could be called outside of the function. . Outside the function: I made 2 new variables &quot;questions&quot;, and &quot;correct_answer&quot; which is later used to say the amount of question and correct answers. I then introduce the quiz by saying that the user will be asked 5 questions. For extra credit, I used lists and iterations to make a question list and an answer list. Then I used index (i) to make it so that if the user&#39;s answer was equal to the corresponding answer_list answer, then a correct answer response was given. If the answer that the user gave did not match the corresponding answer_list answer, then an incorrct answer response was given. I then also told the user how many correct answers they got out of the total amount of questions. .",

Artemia (brine shrimp) is a genus of very small anostracan crustaceans found in saline habitats. They are distantly related to a number of other small to microscopic crustaceans - Triops (Notostraca), water fleas (Cladocera), and clam shrimp (‘Conchostraca’). . Description . Artemia and other Anostraca are generally elongated, with an anatomy somewhat ‘generic’ among crustaceans, though they have only 1 pair of well-developed antennae. . | They utilize 11 pairs of thoracic legs and a set of ‘flukes’ on their tails to swim, which they do upside-down. . | To feed, they may scrape organic material from available surfaces or filter particles from the water. . | . Common food source for birds, certain insects, fishes, and larger crustaceans . | Maximum length of just over 1cm . | Healthiest food for them is the microscopic algae Dunaliella viridis . | As passive filter feeders, brine shrimp collect whatever is in the water and sweep it into their mouths . | Brine shrimp may become dormant in cysts in order to resist extreme environmental conditions until the environment becomes more favorable. . | . Life Cycle . Brine shrimp start out as cysts until the water warms, after which they become larvae (nauplii) .

The survival of organisms in the wild is often affected by various environmental abiotic factors. In the case of the anostracan Artemia salina, these include a water temperature of 25°C, a pH of 8.1, minimal water movement, &lt;20 mPa of pressure and high (≤50%) salinity. A. salina is generally found at low depths and presumably requires relatively high oxygen levels and normal light/dark cycling. A. salina is highly vulnerable to poisoning by metallic elements and all life stages are killed by ionizing radiation. . Problem . What will be the effect of different acidity levels within the surrounding environment on the development of the brine shrimp? . Hypothesis and Experimental Setup . This experiment investigated the effects of modulating pH on A. salina nauplii survival rates. The null hypothesis is: “Addition of sulfuric acid to water will not affect the proportion of surviving brine shrimp.” The alternative hypothesis is: “If sulfuric acid is added to water to make it more acidic, then the proportion of brine shrimp that survive over the course of the experiment will decrease.” . There were three petri dishes making up three experimental groups. Each petri dish was filled with saltwater with brine shrimp. The groups are as follows: a control group in which no acid was added to the saltwater, a treatment group with a water pH of 7, and a treatment group with a water pH of 6. Sulfuric acid was added to the treatment groups to decrease pH, and as such, the amount of pH was the independent variable. During the experiment, the number of brine shrimp dead and alive was measured over 24-hour intervals to reflect a dependent variable of brine shrimp viability . Materials and Procedures . To conduct an experiment to test these hypotheses, the following materials were gathered: . Salt based water (50 mL) in a large container . | 3 Petri Dishes . | Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) . | Brine Shrimp . | Sharpies . | Masking tape . | Three 50 mL beakers . | 10 mL graduated cylinder . | Pipette . | Shoebin with brine shrimp and salt-based water . | Light source . | . Using these materials, the following procedure was followed: . 1) &gt; 3 petri dishes were labeled with masking tape and a sharpie as “Control pH = 8”, ‘“Experimental group #1 pH = 7”, and “Experimental group #2 pH = 6”. The appropriate identification of all three petri dishes was also labeled(in this case, Table 5 Period 4) . 2) &gt; A 50 mL beaker was used to scoop saltwater out of a larger container. 30 mL of saltwater was measured out using the 10 mL graduated cylinder and added to each petri dish. . 3) &gt; Sulfuric acid was added to each petri dish until the pH of the two treatment groups were in correspondence with their assigned labels. . 4) &gt; A 50 mL beaker was used to scoop from the shoebin with brine shrimp, and was exposed to light. . 5) &gt; A pipette was used to transfer brine shrimp from the beaker into another beaker to reduce the volume of eggs. . 6) &gt; A pipette was used to squirt brine shrimp into each petri dish from the container. . 7) &gt; The number in each petri dish of brine shrimp was counted and recorded; a light on each petri dish while counting to clearly see the shrimp. Record this in the data table. . 8) &gt; Return to the petri dishes 24 hours and 48 hours after they were set up. Count the number of live and dead brine shrimp in each petri dish; shine a light on each petri dish while counting to clearly see the shrimp. . Constants . It is important to ensure only the independent variable changes during an experiment, in this case, the pH of water in each petri dish. All other variables must be controlled. Some constants include the water temperature, which remained constant as the petri dishes were kept within an air-conditioned classroom and stored in the same shelf when not in use. In addition, the time intervals between the groups were kept consistent; this includes the time of day each experimental group was set up and the time of day data was collected from each group (both of which were either near 12:00 or 12:30), as well as the length of time that data was collected (over two days). Finally, the salinity of the water in each petri dish was kept constant, given that the water was derived from the same two containers (one with saltwater and one with brine shrimp). . Data . Table 1: Brine Shrimp Viability .     0 hours   24 hours   48 hours   . Dish # | pH | Alive | Dead | Alive | Dead | Alive | Dead | . 1 | 8 | 10 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 12 | 2 | . 2 | 7 | 11 | 0 | 18 | 2 | 9 | 4 | . 3 | 6 | 10 | 0 | 17 | 1 | 17 | 3 | . . Discussion and Conclusions . Conclusive results cannot be drawn due to a number of confounding factors. Some of these include brine shrimp eggs that were placed in the petri dishes along with the live brine shrimp. A number of eggs hatched during the period between the first two data collections, resulting in an increase in the number of brine shrimp in each setup. In addition, some individuals observed during the second data collection were not found, alive or dead, in the third (one in the control and 7 in the pH 7 setup). All data collection was done manually in periods of 5 minutes each, likely resulting in random error. . If a future experiment were conducted, more accurate results can be achieved by implementing an automatic counting system and extracting only hatched brine shrimp from the original holding container. A repetition of the experiment with the changes made above would be helpful in taking data leading to conclusive results. Consideration of further research avenues may proceed following the procurement of genuine results. . Works Cited . Artemia salina, https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Artemia_salina/.

          "content": ". . This year’s vocabulary includes: . Trimester 1 . Function - A group of related statements that perform a specific task | Def - The command to define a function | Parameter - Variables for the values the function needs. Is passed as an argument when the function is called | Variable - A way of storing values into the memory of the computer by using specific names that you define | List - A “container” that can store any kinds of values | Repository - A location where all the files for a particular project are stored | String - A series of readable or usable sentences that the user will use | len() - Returns the length (the number of items) of an object | Return - Used to return from a function (break out of the function) | . Trimester 2 . Bits - Smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store | Bytes - A unit of data that is eight binary digits long | Hexadecimal - A numbering system with base 16 | Binary Numbers - A numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit – 0 or 1 : Unsigned Integer - Just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don’t have a + or - sign associated with them | Signed Integer - Represent both positive and negative numbers | Floating Point - A positive or negative whole number with a decimal point | . | Binary Data Abstractions - Reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole: Boolean - A logical data type that can have only the values true or false | ASCII - The most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet | Unicode - Universal character representation standard for text in computer processing | RGB - A system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display | . | Data Compression - the process of encoding, restructuring or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce its size: Lossy - the data in a file is removed and not restored to its original form after decompression | Lossless - restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed | . | Variable - A value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program | Data types - A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error | Assignment Operation - The operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element | Managing Complexity with Variables - Establishes a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level: Lists - abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once | 2D Lists - collection of data cells, all of the same type, which can be given a single name | Dictionaries - an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs | Class - template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object | Algorithms - a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation | Sequence - the order in which the statements are executed | Selection - a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met | Iteration - a process where the design of a product or application is improved by repeated review and testing | Expressions - a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value | Comparison Operators - used to compare the values within an expression, such as to check if the value held by a variable matches the value held by another variable | Booleans Expressions and Selection - a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE and can be selected | Booleans Expressions and Iteration - a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE where a process can be repeated | Truth Tables - a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit | Characters - a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol | Strings - a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable | Length - The length of a data type, can be number of characters or number of data | Concatenation - the operation of joining two strings together | Upper - Uppercase characters | Lower - Lowercase characters | Traversing Strings - accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript | Python If, Elif, Else conditionals - expressions that evaluate to either true or false | Nested Selection Statements - used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task | Python For, While loops with Range, with List - a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached | Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue - Conditionals that occur while a specific process is being repeated - can be stopped or passed | Procedural Abstraction - when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters | Python Def procedures - A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name | Parameters - a special kind of variable used in a function to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the function | Return Values - ends the execution of a function, and returns control to the calling function | . | .",
