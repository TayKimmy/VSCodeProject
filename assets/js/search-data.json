I just chose the picture where there was a direct path between P and S but I should’ve chosen the one with the least paths between P and S. | | 39 | I got this question wrong because I was unsure about open standards and protocols. I didn’t know that it allowed hardware and software to be build by different manufacturers so I just guessed that it had to do with reuse of materials. | | 43 | I thought that the number of steps was too much to b e considered reasonable. Even though it seems like a lot, it is actually reasonable because it increases at a linear rate. | | 46 | I forgot the definition of an undecidable problem. No algorithm can solve an undeciable problem for any program or input but I thought that it could, just not in reasonable time. | | 47 | I was being careless on this problem. The sender’s keys don’t matter if the sender uses the recipient’s key to encode the message. So since the public key was used, the recipient’s private key is needed for decryption. | | 60 | I kind of forget what documentation was. Documentation is like comments in the code, and reducing documentation will increase the complexity of the program. | | 64 | I was also being clueless and careless on this problem. Cloud computing allows files to be shared easily, which can cause concerns about illegal distribution of others’ properties. | .",

The “http” layer is an application layer protocol in the TCP/IP stack, used for communication between web browsers and web servers. It is the protocol used for transmitting data over the World Wide Web. . The “transport” layer (TCP) is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications running on different hosts. The TCP protocol segments the data into smaller chunks called “segments”. Each segment contains a sequence number that identifies its position in the original stream of data, as well as other control information such as source and destination port numbers, and checksums for error detection. . The “ip” layer is responsible for packetizing data received from the TCP layer of the protocol stack, and then encapsulating the data into IP packets. The IP packets are then sent to the lower layers of the protocol stack for transmission over the network. . The “network” layer is responsible for routing data packets between networks using the Internet Protocol (IP).

            "content": "What is a Hashtable/Hashmap? . A hashtable is a data structure that with a collection of key-value pairs, where each key maps to a value, and the keys must be unique and hashable. . In Python there is a built in hashtable known as a dictionary. | . The primary purpose of a hashtable is to provide efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. When an element is to be inserted into the hashtable, a hash function is used to map the key to a specific index in the underlying array that is used to store the key-value pairs. The value is then stored at that index. When searching for a value, the hash function is used again to find the index where the value is stored. . The key advantage of a hashtable over other data structures like arrays and linked lists is its average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. . The typical time complexity of a hashtable is O(1), or constant time. | . What is Hashing and Collision? . Hashing is the process of mapping a given key to a value in a hash table or hashmap, using a hash function. The hash function takes the key as input and produces a hash value or hash code, which is then used to determine the index in the underlying array where the value is stored. The purpose of hashing is to provide a quick and efficient way to access data, by eliminating the need to search through an entire data structure to find a value. . However, it is possible for two different keys to map to the same hash value, resulting in a collision. When a collision occurs, there are different ways to resolve it, depending on the collision resolution strategy used. . Python&#39;s dictionary implementation is optimized to handle collisions efficiently, and the performance of the dictionary is generally very good, even in the presence of collisions. However, if the number of collisions is very high, the performance of the dictionary can degrade, so it is important to choose a good hash function that minimizes collisions when designing a Python dictionary. . What is a Set? . my_set = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) print(my_set) # What do you notice in the output? # # # Why do you think Sets are in the same tech talk as Hashmaps/Hashtables? # # . {1, 2, 3} . Dictionary Example . Below are just some basic features of a dictionary.

Favorite Taylor Swift Song Seed . My favorite Taylor Swift song is Love Story. Love Story is on many of my Spotify playlists that I listen to frequently because I like it so much. I first heard it in many Instagram edits and I loved the catchy tune. I was also reading Romeo and Juliet at the time, and I greatly appreciated the reference to the great romance tragedy classic by William Shakespeare. I also liked the theme of young romance and it helped me relate to it. A song of impossible fantasy. I also loved the melody and it was very easy to hum or sing along to. I also enjoyed Taylor Swift&#39;s singing in the song, which was soft yet powerful. She sang in way that made the lyrics stand out and enabled me to hear it clearly. I especially liked the parts where the dad says &quot;Stay Away from Juliet&quot; because it shows a kind of forbidden love. I also like the part . &quot;Marry me, Juliet, you&#39;ll never have to be alone . I love you, and that&#39;s all I really know . I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress . It&#39;s a love story, baby, just say yes&quot; . because it shows a happy ending and this part of song is especially exciting. I just enjoyed the calmness of the song and this is one of the greatest songs ever. .",

It also has a smaller population, which enables students to get closer to faculty and make closer relationships. CSU San Marcos is a relatively new campus, and was originally a poultry farm before it was transformed into a college. Many engineering buildings have been built and there are some planned to be built. Over 250 stairs are at the campus. There are multiple pathways present in CSU Marcos - Computer Engineering (Starting this fall), Applied Physics, Math, Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, etc. Many departments as well: Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Biological Sciences, Math, Computer Science, etc. Many STEM clubs active in campus - Cybersecurity Club, Robotics, 3D Printing, Women in STEM, etc. . . Internships . Internships are a period of work experience that students can do. How to find internships: . Attend school events for useful information | Google | Check student email | . . Programs . Summer Scholars Program Is a 10 week summer program that provides students with an intensive research experience together with enrichment activities aimed at career development. It also helps preparation for graduate school | . | Quantum Bridge Program Incoming students get to work and research in the field of quantum mechanics and physics | . | Other programs: Chemistry and Biochemistry Targeted Learning | . | . . Research . Multiple research experiences in CSU San Marcos. . Cancer cell research, Meteorite Research, etc. | . . Paying for College . 2 types of loans: . Subsidized and unsubsidized Direct subsidized loans and direct unsubsidized loans are federal student loans offered by the U.S. Department of Education to help eligible studentscover the cost of higher education at a four-year college or university, community college, or trade, career, or technical school. | Subsidized loans Does not accrue interest while you are in school | . | Unsubsidized loans Does accrue interest while you are in school Scholarships and Grants: | . | How to find them: Apply for FAFSA, studentaid.gov | Google | Financial Aid Office | Check student email for scholarship opportunities | . | . . Life after CSUSM . Continue ontu graduate school and other professional programs | A career in biomedical, environmental, chemical, and electronics fields | A career in a variety of government agencies | Become an educator either in K-12 or higher ed. | . . Stem Activity Video . Link . . Takeaways . Through this opportunity, I learned much more about the California State University at San Marcos, such as its classes and departments. I learned about pathways I can take there and good opportunities given at CSUSM. I also learned about scholarships, grants, loans, internships, and more. I learned about advantanges and downfalls of doing certain things and I gained advice about college applications. I also was able to narrow down my choice of college majors/pathway and what colleges I should apply to. At the end of class we did a small hands-on experience with electrical engineering, which was not only fun and interactive, but piqued my interest in the engineering field. .",

            "content": "Space and Time Complexity . Space complexity refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to complete its execution, as a function of the size of the input. The space complexity of an algorithm can be affected by various factors such as the size of the input data, the data structures used in the algorithm, the number and size of temporary variables, and the recursion depth. Time complexity refers to the amount of time required by an algorithm to run as the input size grows. It is usually measured in terms of the &quot;Big O&quot; notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm&#39;s time complexity. . Why do you think a programmer should care about space and time complexity? . Space and time complexity can help the program run in optimal conditions. Too much memory can cause the computer to crash and it will expensive to the user or the programmer if they have to upgrade their storage every single time. Users would also like to have a program that runs quickly, so programmers have to care about time complexity to make the user experience better. Space and time complexity can also help the programmer decide what they need to fix in their program and what they should strive for. | .

Do you think this is a time complexity or space complexity or both problem? . It is a both problem but space complexity is ultimately more of a problem. Because the larger the image, the more space and memory it takes up, space complexity is more of a problem. Space complexity is the cause of the time complexity, because the program takes longer to run the bigger the image is. | . Big O Notation .

Constant O(1) . Time . An example of a constant time algorithm is accessing a specific element in an array. It does not matter how large the array is, accessing an element in the array takes the same amount of time. Therefore, the time complexity of this operation is constant, denoted by O(1). . print(numbers[263]) ncaa_bb_ranks = {1:&quot;Alabama&quot;,2:&quot;Houston&quot;, 3:&quot;Purdue&quot;, 4:&quot;Kansas&quot;} #look up a value in a dictionary given a key print(ncaa_bb_ranks[1]) . 263 Alabama . Space . This function takes two number inputs and returns their sum. The function does not create any additional data structures or variables that are dependent on the input size, so its space complexity is constant, or O(1). Regardless of how large the input numbers are, the function will always require the same amount of memory to execute. . def sum(a, b): return a + b print(sum(90,88)) print(sum(.9,.88)) . 178 1.78 . Linear O(n) . Time . An example of a linear time algorithm is traversing a list or an array. When the size of the list or array increases, the time taken to traverse it also increases linearly with the size. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the size of the list or array being traversed. . for i in numbers: print(i) . Space . This function takes a list of elements arr as input and returns a new list with the elements in reverse order. The function creates a new list reversed_arr of the same size as arr to store the reversed elements. The size of reversed_arr depends on the size of the input arr, so the space complexity of this function is O(n). As the input size increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases linearly. . def reverse_list(arr): n = len(arr) reversed_arr = [None] * n #create a list of None based on the length or arr for i in range(n): reversed_arr[n-i-1] = arr[i] #stores the value at the index of arr to the value at the index of reversed_arr starting at the beginning for arr and end for reversed_arr return reversed_arr print(numbers) print(reverse_list(numbers)) .

Quadratic O(n^2) . Time . An example of a quadratic time algorithm is nested loops. When there are two nested loops that both iterate over the same collection, the time taken to complete the algorithm grows quadratically with the size of the collection. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(n^2), where n is the size of the collection being iterated over. . for i in numbers: for j in numbers: print(i,j) . Space . This function takes two matrices matrix1 and matrix2 as input and returns their product as a new matrix. The function creates a new matrix result with dimensions m by n to store the product of the input matrices. The size of result depends on the size of the input matrices, so the space complexity of this function is O(n^2). As the size of the input matrices increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function also increases quadratically. . Matrix . Main take away is that a new matrix is created. | . def multiply_matrices(matrix1, matrix2): m = len(matrix1) n = len(matrix2[0]) result = [[0] * n] * m #this creates the new matrix based on the size of matrix 1 and 2 for i in range(m): for j in range(n): for k in range(len(matrix2)): result[i][j] += matrix1[i][k] * matrix2[k][j] return result print(multiply_matrices([[1,2],[3,4]], [[3,4],[1,2]])) . [[18, 28], [18, 28]] . Logarithmic O(logn) . Time . An example of a log time algorithm is binary search. Binary search is an algorithm that searches for a specific element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. As a result, the time taken to complete the search grows logarithmically with the size of the list. Hence, the time complexity of this operation is O(log n), where n is the size of the list being searched. . def binary_search(arr, low, high, target): while low &lt;= high: mid = (low + high) // 2 #integer division if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &lt; target: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 target = 263 result = binary_search(numbers, 0, len(numbers) - 1, target) print(result) . 263 . Space . The same algorithm above has a O(logn) space complexity. The function takes an array arr, its lower and upper bounds low and high, and a target value target. The function searches for target within the bounds of arr by recursively dividing the search space in half until the target is found or the search space is empty. The function does not create any new data structures that depend on the size of arr. Instead, the function uses the call stack to keep track of the recursive calls. Since the maximum depth of the recursive calls is O(logn), where n is the size of arr, the space complexity of this function is O(logn). As the size of arr increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows logarithmically. . Exponential O(2^n) . Time . An example of an O(2^n) algorithm is the recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. The recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence calculates each number by recursively calling itself with the two preceding numbers until it reaches the base case (i.e., the first or second number in the sequence). The algorithm takes O(2^n) time in the worst case because it has to calculate each number in the sequence by making two recursive calls. . Fibonacci . def fibonacci(n): if n &lt;= 1: return n else: return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) #print(fibonacci(5)) #print(fibonacci(10)) #print(fibonacci(20)) #print(fibonacci(30)) print(fibonacci(40)) . 102334155 . Space . This function takes a set s as input and generates all possible subsets of s. The function does this by recursively generating the subsets of the set without the first element, and then adding the first element to each of those subsets to generate the subsets that include the first element. The function creates a new list for each recursive call that stores the subsets, and each element in the list is a new list that represents a subset. The number of subsets that can be generated from a set of size n is 2^n, so the space complexity of this function is O(2^n). As the size of the input set increases, the amount of memory required to execute the function grows exponentially. . def generate_subsets(s): if not s: return [[]] subsets = generate_subsets(s[1:]) return [[s[0]] + subset for subset in subsets] + subsets print(generate_subsets([1,2,3,4,5,6])) #print(generate_subsets(numbers)) .

Hacks . Record your findings when testing the time elapsed of the different algorithms. | Although we will go more in depth later, time complexity is a key concept that relates to the different sorting algorithms. Do some basic research on the different types of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. | Why is time and space complexity important when choosing an algorithm? | Should you always use a constant time algorithm / Should you never use an exponential time algorithm? Explain? | What are some general patterns that you noticed to determine each algorithm&#39;s time and space complexity? | . Complete the Time and Space Complexity analysis questions linked below. Practice . Hacks solved . Findings . The time elapsed for Constant algorithms - O(1) - is constant. The time and space complexity is always the same no matter what. | The time elapsed for Linear algorithms - O(N) - changes at a constant rate as the size of the file/list/array increases. The increase is constant, so it is linear not exponential. As the size increases, the amount of memory required also increases at a constant rate. | The time elapsed for Quadratic algorithm - O(N^2) - increases at a quadratic rate as the size increases. Instead of increasing at a constant rate, it increases by either double, triple, quadruple, etc. | The time elapsed for Logarithmic algorithms - O(logn) - decreases at an exponential rate as the size increases. Like binary search, the time divides by half each time. | The time elapsed for Exponential algorithms - O(2^N) - increasea at an exponential rate as the size increases. Like recursions, the time increases exponentially. | . Research . Selection Sort - O(N^2) | Merge Sort - O(log(N)) | Count Sort - O(N+K) | Quick Sort - O(log(N)) | Heap Sort - O(log(N)) | Tree Sort - O(log(N)) | . Importance . Time and space complexity is important because it can determine the user&#39;s experience. It will also determine how well the algorithm will work and hoe well the program will work as intended. If the algorithm takes too long, then the program will not run and may even crash the program. If certain algorithms require too much memory and &quot;space&quot;, then the program will also not run and may crash. Therefore, time and space complextiy must be taken into account when choosing an algorithm. . Constant vs Exponential . Constant time algorithms are generally much better than exponenial algorithms. Even when the list/array/file is not that big, the exponential algorithm will take much longer than the constant algorithm. However, if the list or file is small, then it may be better for exponential algorithms to be used because it can be quicker than constant algorithms. . General Patterns . No matter the algorithm, the bigger the list, array, or file traversed, the longer the time and memory it takes for the program to run. Some algorithms just take significantly less time, but they all increase. What the algorithm does also changes how long it takes. Binary search, for example, cuts down the list by half every single time, which is why it is much faster than exponential algorithms. Algorithms that have to iterate through the list, and sometimes more than once, causes it to take so much time. . Practice Problems .

The dictionary is then printed as a dataframe, with index starting from 0. . import pandas as pd #the data can be stored as a python dictionary dict = { &quot;calories&quot;: [420, 380, 390], &quot;duration&quot;: [50, 40, 45] } #stores the data in a data frame print(&quot;-Dict_to_DF&quot;) df = pd.DataFrame(dict) print(df) print(&quot;-Dict_to_DF_labels--&quot;) #or with the index argument, you can label rows. df = pd.DataFrame(dict, index = [&quot;day1&quot;, &quot;day2&quot;, &quot;day3&quot;]) print(df) . -Dict_to_DF calories duration 0 420 50 1 380 40 2 390 45 -Dict_to_DF_labels-- calories duration day1 420 50 day2 380 40 day3 390 45 . Examine DataFrame Rows . This prints the previous database using a selected row. . The first one prints 2 separate rows while the second prints 1 specfic row. . print(&quot;-Examine Selected Rows&quot;) #use a list for multiple labels: print(df.loc[[&quot;day1&quot;, &quot;day3&quot;]]) #refer to the row index: print(&quot;--Examine Single Row--&quot;) print(df.loc[&quot;day1&quot;]) . -Examine Selected Rows calories duration day1 420 50 day3 390 45 --Examine Single Row-- calories 420 duration 50 Name: day1, dtype: int64 . Pandas DataFrame Information . This prints the dataframe information: . Number of entries | Number of columnts | Type | Memory usage | . print(df.info()) . &lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt; Index: 3 entries, day1 to day3 Data columns (total 2 columns): # Column Non-Null Count Dtype -- -- 0 calories 3 non-null int64 1 duration 3 non-null int64 dtypes: int64(2) memory usage: 180.0+ bytes None . Example of larger data set . Pandas can read CSV and many other types of files, run the following code to see more features with a larger data set . This uses a different file - data.csv . This prints the file using the duration column - it prints the top 10 and bottom 10 duration values . import pandas as pd #read csv and sort &#39;Duration&#39; largest to smallest df = pd.read_csv(&#39;files/data.csv&#39;).sort_values(by=[&#39;Duration&#39;], ascending=False) print(&quot;--Duration Top 10&quot;) print(df.head(10)) print(&quot;--Duration Bottom 10&quot;) print(df.tail(10)) . --Duration Top 10 Duration Pulse Maxpulse Calories 69 300 108 143 1500.2 79 270 100 131 1729.0 109 210 137 184 1860.4 60 210 108 160 1376.0 106 180 90 120 800.3 90 180 101 127 600.1 65 180 90 130 800.4 61 160 110 137 1034.4 62 160 109 135 853.0 67 150 107 130 816.0 --Duration Bottom 10 Duration Pulse Maxpulse Calories 68 20 106 136 110.4 100 20 95 112 77.7 89 20 83 107 50.3 135 20 136 156 189.0 94 20 150 171 127.4 95 20 151 168 229.4 139 20 141 162 222.4 64 20 110 130 131.4 112 15 124 139 124.2 93 15 80 100 50.5 .

M . numpy . Numpy is described as &quot;The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python&quot;. In the Image Lab, a Numpy array is created from the image data in order to simplify access and change to the RGB values of the pixels, converting pixels to grey scale. . io, BytesIO . Input and Output (I/O) is a fundamental of all Computer Programming. Input/output (I/O) buffering is a technique used to optimize I/O operations. In large quantities of data, how many frames of input the server currently has queued is the buffer. In this example, there is a very large picture that lags. . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? | . I have experienced buffering many times, the majority in my home when I am on my computer or watching TV. . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? | . Whenever there is a lot of data, a lot of users, and a lot of inputs, there is buffering. A lot of times when I am watching a movie or a video, the video doesn&#39;t load because it is buffering. Sometimes, a game that I am playing may lag and buffer, especially if a lot of effects (i.e. a ton of bullets) appear on the screen. . How do these effects apply to images? | . When there are large images or very graphic images, buffering tends to occur more. . Data Structures, Imperative Programming Style, and working with Images . Introduction to creating meta data and manipulating images. Look at each procedure and explain the the purpose and results of this program. Add any insights or challenges as you explored this program. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? The code slightly seems like a series of steps. There are multiple functions being performed in order and there are many operations done within each function. . | Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? The algorithm first receives a scaled size of the image, and data is retrieved from the image. The amount of pixels retreived is then averaged and appended to the data. The image data is then returned. . | Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? The scale image scales the height and width of the image to a certain amount. Some images are scaled to a bigger size while others are shrunk. . | Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? . | . Scale is a type of compression - lossless compression.

Classes that participate include AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, 3D Animations, CSP, CSA, Ceramics, Digital Media, and more. During the event, all the students, as well as their parents, are invited to come to have fun and look at other peoples’ achievements. The band also plays music outside for people to listen to. . . My Insights . I really enjoyed N@TM this trimester. I knew a lot of the people here - mainly from CSP - and I was able to have a lot of fun. I also showed off my project to other people - including the teacher - who gave insight on our project and possible improvements. I was able to see projects and artworks from other classes and I was amazed at how good some of they looked. For example, I really enjoyed looking at the arts in AP Studio Art because they were so realisitc and looked very good. I also liked looking at the ceramics because I didn’t really know how the they created those sculptures. . . Screenshots . . AP CSA .

Users can look at live data and which cars are most liked and dislike | Rankings are constantly updated Screenshot: | . . How it fits Collegeboard Criteria . Program Purpose and Function . My program will have input and output - the input is when the user clicks the like or dislike of a certain model and the output is the test that says whatever car is most liked/disliked - and a definite purpose and function. The purpose of the program is for people to see which cars are most popular currently and which cars are most disliked. Users can press any like/dislike button of any model, and when they reload the page, a new most liked/disliked car appears at the bottom of the page. | . Data Abstraction . I will use a list to store data about how many users have clicked the buttons. I will then access the list later on to find out which car is most liked and disliked. | . Managing Complexity . I will use a list to manage complexity that stores the amount of times a button has been clicked. Without this list, I would have to manually store each button click in an individual variable. This would make the code longer, inefficient, and harder to read. | . Procedural Abstraction . I will develop a procedure with parameters that are used. This procedure will determine which button has been clicked the most, and this will be separate from the like and dislike button. Whichever like button is clicked the most, that car is the most liked car, and whichever dislike button is clicked the most, that car is the most disliked car. | . Algorithm implementation . My procedure will contain an algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. Using a for loop, I iterate through all the buttons. I use selection by using an if statement, and I find the highest values by seeing if it was previously used. This algorithm will be performed in a sequential manner. | . Testing . The program will have two separate calls to the procedure - a like button and a dislike button being clicked. The conditions that are tested are that the number of clicks increases and may result in new cars at the bottom. | . . Video Ideas . I will create a video showing the table and what it outputs. I will show clicking different buttons and, after reloading the page, show how the two cars outputted on the bottom of the page may change if the number of likes/dislikes also changes. .",

Dopamine issues are real - Many kids are addicted to games or social media, and are always on either phones, computers, PCs, or gaming consoles. | For a few kids, these issues impact their studying and success in High School They can’t focus in school | They don’t do homework, and instead, play games and post on social media | Social media also creates stress as desire for likes and followers can create anxiety and depression | Gaming and social media can also lead to cyberbullying in toxic online communities | . | These don’t affect my personal studying and success in High School Although I play games, I don’t play as much as others and I am not addicted | I use few social media platforms, and mainly for texting. I don’t care about followers, posts, or likes. | . | . . Big Idea 5.2 - Digital Divide . Digital Empowerment: . Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by gaining knowledge about devices and how they work They can also buy devices such as TVs, phones, tablets, and computers (if the devices are affordable and available) | Not all people can empower themselves, though, because of multiple causes: They may not have the money to buy devices | They may not have the opportunity to learn more about devices | There may be nore available devices or learning because the place they live in is demoderinzed | | . | Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered in a multitude of ways: Buy them devices | Give them opportunities to learn more about devices | Give them financial/digital aid | Teach them about devices and how to buy one | | At Del Norte, students can start fundraisers to raise money to buy devices - phones, computers, printers, etc. - for those who cannot afford them and do not have access to them on a regular basis | There are barriers blocking digital empowerment: Places such as Third World Countries generally do not have as much access to devices compared to countries like the U.S. This is not just an issue of money, but availability and access | These place does not even have this type of technology nor are there opportunities for people to learn more about technology | . | Even in “rich” countries, barriers still block a few from digital empowerment: Generally, these are issues of money People don’t have the money to buy devices or learn more about them | . | Often, there are other priorities for these people: Rent, housing, food, jobs, tranportation | . | . | . | There are such barriers in Del Norte, but not as apparent There are a few kids who probably don’t have the ability to buy devices because their parents do not earn enough money | . | . . Big Idea 5.3 - Computing bias . Intentional/Purpose Bias - (TikTok vs Facebook, etc.): . Generally, older generations use Facebook while younger generations use TikTok Causes advertisement bias - Facebook tries to attract older customers while TikTok tries to attract younger customers This is because they both know who their audience is | . | This trend is most likely to be caused by the types of platform Facebook is more informational and includes articles while TikTok is more entertainment Younger people want entertainment - may also be the fact that younger generations have shorter attention spans | . | . | This trend is not harmful and there is no reason for it to be corrected Doesn’t create any sort of stereotypes or damage society | . | . | There are a variety of reasons that virtual assistants like Alex and Siri have female voices One is the idea that men have a bigger presence in management and facilitation, while women just have a helping role | Another is the idea of mothers, and female assistants can “take care” of users | Another is similar to the idea of nurses - generally people think of nurses as women because it reassures them | This should be corrected because it is harmful to society Backs up the stereotype that women are subordinate to men and women only have helping roles in society This stereotype may be applied to society | . | . | There is now male virtual assistants but the default is still female Even if the default became male, the idea that men are dominant and primary may become prominent instead of the idea of men being in management | . | . | There are multiple algorithms that influences the decisions of users Algorithms based on the user’s previous data In Netflix, it recommends new TV Shows and Movies based on previous ones you watched | . | Algorithms based on all users’ data In Netflix, it gives the most popular shows and movies currently | In Google and Amazon, the most popular websites and products are shown | . | . | . Racist Computer: . This aspect of the product is probably not intentional because there is no reason for the makers to specifically exclude black people If there was, then the product probably wouldn’t have made it into the markets | . | This probably happened due to lack of efficient testing If creators tested the camera using multiples ethnic groups, races, demographics, etc., then this mistake would have been discovered and debugged properly | This leads to the question - how could testing be better? The camera can be set up in public places - such as banks, ATM’s, security stores, etc., and see how it reacts to different people and locations | More people can be used as test subjects | . | . | Even though this wasn’t intentional it is still harmful and should be corrected Gives the idea of skin color a bad meaning | Racial stereotypes | Can also cause security problems If the camera can’t detect certain people, it may not do what it is supposed to do | . | . | . . Big Idea 5.4 - Crowdsourcing . Crowdsource idea for CSP: . A possible idea for crowdsourcing could be a poll or a survey that evaluates maybe the class or the lessons This could be initiated in the environment by having links in the APCSP website | Teachers can also tell students about it | . | Another idea is the friendly sharing of code - kind of like what GitHub and RapidAPI enables users to do Maybe there can be a time in class where people can go around sharing ideas and code - enables some to gain new insight | . | . Del Norte crowdsourcing: . Polls and surveys can be set up to evaluate certain things Amount of homework and studying, self appreciation, mental health, sports, campus spirit/community, etc. | This can be implemented by having posters with links and qr codes around campus Teachers can also send links to students | . | . | Students can also be asked series of questions - interview style - around campus randomly Can be asked questions about campus community, mental health, how they feel about coming to school, how welcom they feel, etc. | . | . Project improvement with crowdsourcing: . We can maybe have a poll/survey on the project for users to evaluate out project Users can be asked what they like about the website, what can be improved, etc | . | We can also see how many users sign in and which aspect of our website they like the most This data can be used to see what parts of the website should be fixed | . | We can also use GitHub or other sources of code sharing to see how other groups implemented certain aspects We can use inspiration from these ideas to improve ours | . | .

Open Source MIT License: Allows code to be used freely | Making and distributing closed source versions | Authors get credit Credit can be as simple as including the author’s name | . | Closed source means GitHub project can be private | . | Open Source GPL License: Lets people do virtually anything with users’ project Distributing closed source versions are not allowed | . | GitHub project must be public for open source Summary of Discussion: | . | Copyrights can be both good and bad It is good for creators because others can’t just copy their idea and implement it into their own thing | It can be bad for users because it may be hard for users to access certain things like books and movies because of copyright | . | A license provides legal guidelings for use and distribution of software | There are many legal and ethical thoughts There are websites to bypass the legal licenses but this is unethical and illegal | The only ethical way is to do it the legal way License for our Repository | . | My individual FastPages GPL License It is just a simple fastpages, so I don’t want users to be restricted. | . | . | Frontend Team Repository MIT License I would like users to be able to access the website and do different things with it, instead of being limited in the amount of tasks they can do | . | . | Backend Team Repository MIT License Users should be able to use code as a reference and gain inspiration | . | . | . . Big Idea 5.6 - Safe Computing . There are a lot of PII I have seen in CSP Names, emails, usernames, accomplishments - many are from GitHub and people’s personal fastpage | People also sign in to various things, such as our own project, using their name and email, maybe even phone number | . | I think that some PII is good to post while many others are very harmful to post Things like names, emails, accomplishments (Linkedin), schools attended, etc. are good to post because people get to know more about you while you don’t expose yourself to dangerous things | Things like phone numbers, address, drivers license, etc. are in the middle, as they can be harmful but are not necessarily always harmful to post | Things like your SSN, you tax records, your banking information, important passwords, stocks, credit cards, passports, etc. are dangerous to post because other people can manipulate and use them to their advantage | . | Good passwords are ones that are long, memorizable, and include letters (both upper and lowercase), numbers, and special characters Passwords that fit the criteria above can still be bad if used repeatedly for multiple sites without changes | Bad passwords are also shorter, easy for people to guess (i.e. password), don’t include a variety of characters, and are obviously connected to the user (name, birthday, etc.) | Another step used in authentication is multi-factor authentication These connect another device to the currently used device - i.e. a phone - and users have to use a verification code that have been texted or emailed through the other device | . | . | Symmetric encryption is a type of encryption where a single key is used to encrypt and decrypt the information/data Asymmetric encryption is a type of encryption where a different key is used to encrypt and decrypt the information/data | . | An example of encryption we used in AWS deployment is SSH keys on GitHub They enabled us to use and write data on GitHub | . | A phishing scheme I learned about the hard way was a faulty link that replaced a single character - for example the APCSP website is nighthawkcoders.github.io but they link they gave could be nighthawkcoder.github.io - no s at the end of nighthawkcoder Some other phishing techniques can include Invoice phishing - scammers tell you that you have an awaiting invoice from a trusted company | Payment phishing - scammers ask you to provide credit card information while acting as a trusted company | Download phishing - phishers email a faulty file to download that can steal your information when you download it | . | . |",

            "content": "Class and Object Terms . The foundations of Object-Oriented Programming is defining a Class . In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

            "content": "Notes . 3.14 . (Fill in the blank) . Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . 3.15 . Random Values are a number generated using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm which gives equal probability to all number occuring . Each Result from randomization is equally likely to occur Using random number generation in a program means each execution may produce a different result . Examples: . Dice | Marbles | . Used in coding: . Games | Statistical Sampling | Cryptography | . 3.14 Libraries Challenges and Homework . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | Import the package as a more convenient name. | import math x = math.factorial(8) print(x) . 40320 . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python library which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a __ to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. . Task: Have fun with turtle! Create something that uses at least 2 lines of different lengths and 2 turns with different angles, and changes at least one setting about either the pen or canvas. Also use one command that isn&#39;t mentioned on the table below(there are a lot). Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Screenshots . Challenge 3: Math . Create a program which asks for a user input of two numbers, and returns the following: . each number rounded up | each number rounded down | the lcm of the rounded down numbers | the gcf of the rounded up numbers | the factorial of each number | something else using the math package! | . import math x = int(input(&quot;Choose a number&quot;)) y = int(input(&quot;Choose a second number&quot;)) print(math.ceil(x)) print(math.ceil(y)) print(math.floor(x)) print(math.floor(y)) print(math.lcm(x,y)) print(math.gcd(x,y)) print(math.factorial(x)) print(math.factorial(y)) print(math.nextafter(x,y)) . 3 4 3 4 12 1 6 24 3.0000000000000004 . Homework - Libraries . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . Screenshots . 3.15 - Random Values Challenges and Homework . Challenge 1 . Write a function that will a simulate a coinflip and print the output EXTRA: Create a function that will randomly select 5 playing Cards and check if the 5 cards are a Royal Flush . import random def coinflip(): x = &quot;&quot; for i in range(4): flip = random.randint(1,2) if flip == 1: x = &quot;Heads&quot; elif flip == 2: x = &quot;Tails&quot; print(&quot;Flip #&quot;, i+1, &quot;:&quot;, x) coinflip() . Flip # 1 : Heads Flip # 2 : Tails Flip # 3 : Heads Flip # 4 : Tails . Homework - Random Values . Given a random decimal number, convert it into binary. If you would like an opportunity for extra points, find a way to convert it into hexadecimal as well. . import random x = random.randint(1, 50) c = bin(x) y = hex(int(c.replace(&quot;0b&quot;,&quot;0&quot;))) print(&quot;The binary of&quot;, x, &quot;is:&quot;, int(c.replace(&quot;0b&quot;, &quot;0&quot;))) print(&quot;The hexadecimal of&quot;, x, &quot;is:&quot;, y) .",

What are some other names for procedures?: Another name for procedures are function. Procedure names can be any name we want, i.e. decimalToBinary() . Why are procedures effective?: Have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program .

            "content": "To define a variable in python, just type in the variable name - one word - and use the = sign to set it equal to it&#39;s value. A variable can be defined using numbers, string, list, or boolean. Strings must have quotations around it and lists must be surrounded by square brackets. Once you have defined a variable, you can do many functions and conditions with it, including the print() statement. . #defining all the variables using the equal sign numbervariable = 25 stringvariable = &quot;word&quot; numberlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] stringlist = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;] israining = False #printing all the defined variables print(numbervariable) print(stringvariable) print(numberlist) print(stringlist) print(israining) . 25 word [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;, &#39;e&#39;] False . Once a variable is defined using a numerical value, mathematical expressions can also be performed on the variable. . number = 5 #defining the variable number x = number * 2 #defining a variable by using another variable print(number*2) # multiplying a variable by 2 print(x) . 10 10 . Once a list is defined, many functions can be performed, such as the append() function. . list = [] list.append(&quot;cookies&quot;) # appending a value to a defined list print(list) . [&#39;cookies&#39;] . A dictionary can also be defined using curly brackets and the equal sign. To input keys and values into a dictionary, you have to use a slightly different approach than lists. . mydict = {&quot;ice cream&quot;:&quot;dairy&quot;} # defining dictionary using curly brackets mydict[&quot;banana&quot;] = &quot;fruit&quot; #add keys and values to a dict by setting a value equal to a key, like shown mydict[&quot;ice cream&quot;] = &quot;dessert&quot; #editing a value inside the dictionary print(mydict) . {&#39;ice cream&#39;: &#39;dessert&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;: &#39;fruit&#39;} . You can also interchange variables by using a temporary variable. In the code below, temp is the temporary variables, and var 1 and var 2 will have their values swapped. This code also works with integers, not just strings. . var1 = &quot;word&quot; # defining first variable var2 = &quot;number&quot; # defining second variable temp = var1 # defining temporary variable using the first variable var1 = var2 # changing the first variable value as the second variable value var2 = temp # changing the second variable value to the first variable value . Variables can also be defined using float data types, instead of just int types, but are used the exact same way. The same mathematical functions also apply. . number = 20.3 #defining a variable usinbg float x = number/10 #defining second variable y = number*2 # defining third variable print(number) # printing first variable print(x) #printing second variable print(y) # printing third variable print(x*y) #printing the second and third variables multiplied . 20.3 2.0300000000000002 40.6 82.418 . The function below takes in a parameter, x, and determines if x is even or odd. Variables can be used within functions to perform a certain task, which in this case, is to determine even or odd. To define a function, use the variable def and use a colon. Make sure there are parenthesis next to the function name, even if the function doesn&#39;t tkae in any parameters. . def IsEven(x): # define the function if x % 2 == 0: # % variable returns the remainder of division # use double equal signs when determining if a value is equal to another value return True if x % 2 != 0: # the != means not equal to return False #printing the values outputted by the function multiple times print(IsEven(24)) print(IsEven(7)) print(IsEven(19)) print(IsEven(30)) .

            "content": ". Questions . A lot of the questions consisted of those on collaboration and its benefits. It also asked questions about the Internet, such as protocols and data transmissions. There were also many questions that gave a block of code and asked for the result or an error in the code. A few problems even described programs and asked potential errors, inputs, outputs, and uses. Some questions asked about coding and data types, such as lists, strings, and variables. There were also some questions on binary numbers, algorithms, indexes, sequences, and results of code. Most of these questions were fairly straightforward, but some of them were misleading, and required a lot of thinking. . . What I missed . I missed 7 questions. Most of these were due to silly mistakes. For example, the question asked to choose 2 answers but I only chose 1. I also missed 1 or 2 questions because I forgot some information about the Internet, protocols, and binary coding. Some problems that included code were also very confusing, often interchanging the values of variables constantly, and then asking for the output. . Question #13: This question showed a block of code that received a list of numbers as a parameter, and returned true if all the numbers were positive. I got this question wrong because I didn’t look at the code carefully. The code only returns false if all the numbers are negative or 0 because of the order of the if statements. I didn’t notice this and I chose the wrong answer. . Question #17: This question tested knowledge on internet protocols. It asked what the use of open protocols were on the Internet. I got this wrong because I didn’t study internet protocols and I forgot what they were and used for. . Question #19: This question tested knowledge on binary sequences. It asked if a 4-bit sequence could add the values 14 and 15 and assign a sum of 29. I did do the adding and binary correctly, and I figured out that a 4-bit sequence could hold the values 14 and 15. Because of this, I said that a 4-bit sequence could be used to perform this function. I didn’t think of the actual sum of 29. A 4-bit sequence couldn’t hold the value 29, but I didn’t think of this and I got the wrong answer. . Question #21: This question tested knowledge on binary and it’s uses. It asked whether binary could be used to represent strings of characters, colors, audio recordings. I didn’t know that binary sequences could be used to represent audio recordings, so I chose the wrong answer. . Question #35: This question gave blocks of code as answer choices and asked which ones performed a specfic function. If the value of a variable of was greater than 120, another variable would be valued as 30, while if the other variable was less than 120, than the variable would be valued as 50. I did get the right answer, but I didn’t see that the question asked for 2 answers. I got this wrong because I only chose one correct answer. . Question #37: This question gave blocks of code as answer choices and asked which one interchanged the values of two different variables. I chose the wrong code because a temporary variable is needed to interchange the values, but I forgot about this fact. . Question #39: This question asked which answer choice was a valid index for the list. I chose -1, because I thought that negative indexes existed. It turns out that list indices are generally nonnegative integers. . . What I can do better . Next time, I will make sure to read the problem carefully, and figure out exactly what it is asking. I can also look at the block of code, if given, more carefully, and comprehend what it is doing. I also have to remember to study some of the AP CSP materials, mainly those about the Internet, including protocols, and binary coding. I also have to study data trannsmissions and algorithms. . . Results . Here is a screenshot of the results of my Trimester 1 Final on Collegeboard. .",

Classes include 3D Animation, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, CSP, CSA, and more. In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best artpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks. . . 3D Animation . Here are a few screenshots of artworks in 3D Animation. As I have already taken this course, I know how the class works and what the curriculum is. But, I still get exposed to new ideas and creative inventions. . . AP/Studio Art . Here are a few screenshots of artworks in Studio Art. I have never been the best at drawing, so I was fascinated by how the artists managed to make their artwork look realistic, and used shading to create a sense of three-dimensional space. . . Ceramics . Here is a screenshot of artworks in Ceramics. I have never even done Ceramics before, so I have no idea how students mold their clay and then dry them into a sculpture as shown above. .",

We also made wireframes using Canva to plan out our project and also design our website before actually making it. It helped prevent errors and problems by fixing and thinking everything through beforehand. We designed all our pages through the wireframme before coding for it in VSCode. . . Problems . We did run into a few problems while making our final project. . One of our problems was formatting the website’s background We had to make it so that the aspect ratio was applicable to any screen size | Some computers showed the background being cut off | . | Another problem we had was getting our API to work At first, we couldn’t extract the questions from our URL and we couldn’t access the JSON file | After we figured that out, we couldn’t figure out how to call the backend code for API in the frontend We have not yet figured this out but we are working on connecting our API to our frontend | . | . | . . Progress . We have made considerable progress in our final project. . This first screenshot shows the homepage for our final project website, named Practice Nexus. We have cards for our two quizzes, a math quiz and a geography quiz. The page is also designed with different colors and images, with a navigation bar to access different parts of the website. . . This second screenshot shows the about us page for our final project website. The page introduces all the team members with the following information: . Role - Scrum Master, Frontend, Backend, DevOps | Age/Grade | Favorite things to do | Link to fastpages | . . We stil have to finish up some designing, as well as implementing our API into frontend. Once we do that, we also have to design each individual quiz page so that one question pops up at a time and answer choices can be selected. We might also include a scoring page, where we keep track of how many questions the user got right/wrong. . We plan to finish this by our design by splitting up the work while also keeping track of everyone else’s work and posting any problems/issues. Backend developers - Me and Luke - will work on coding for scores and also make/use API to get the questions into the Frontend | Frontend developers - Adi and Arnav - will implement the API and use it to get questions into the quiz pages. They will also design all the pages | Since backend doesn’t have as much work, backend developers will also help design and plan out the pages for the quizzes | . | . . Commits .

            "content": "Computer Systems and Network Diagram: . Computer Networks and Systems . A computing device is a physical artifact that can run a program. Computers | Tablets | Servers | Routers | Smart sensors | . | A computer network is a type of computing system | A path between two computing devices on a computer network (a sender and a reciever) is a sequence of directly connected computing devices that begins at the sender and ends at the receiver. | Routing is the process of finding a path from sender to receiver. | The bandwidth of a computer network is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time. | Bandwidth is usually measured in bits per second. | . . How Computers Are Connected . A computing system is a group of computing devices and programs working together for a common purpose. | A computer network is a group of interconnected computing devices capable of sending or receiving data. | . . Packets . A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information. | Packet Switching: The message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device. Ex: Hello. How are you? ==&gt; | Hello. You? How are | . | . | . . The Internet . The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonpropritary) communication protocols. | Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connact a computing dvice to an internet connected device. | Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance | Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets | Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly | Packets may arrive at the destination in order, our of order, or not at all | The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files | The World Wide Web uses the Internet | . . Protocols . A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system. | The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet. | IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet TCP does error checking and error recovery so it is slower | UDP performs error checking, but it discards erroneous packets | . | HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web | . . Internet and Transport Layers . Transport Layer - How the packets are sent, and for what Reliability - reliable - sender gets a receipt back, resend as needed TCP | Unreliability - send and forget. UDP | . | Internet Layer IPv4: Example 192.168.24.1 32 bits, separated into 4 “octets” 8 bits long (0-255) | Separated into 2 parts: Network (1-31) | Device (32-network bits) | . | . | Three targets that can be addressed using IP Unicast - A specific device. Internet wide access. TCP is used. | Multicast - A group of devices. It is specific range of IP addresses. Internet-wide access. UDP is used. | Broadcast - All devices. LAN-wide. Data stops at the router. UDP is used. | . | . . Application Layer . Key protocols used: http. How to ask and receive data from web servers. Normally uses TCP, Port 80 at the transport layer | https. Like http but with security. Usually uses TCP Port 443 | . | Web Servers: Programs running on machines connected to the Internet | Provides clients web pages - data linked to other pages using URLs (Uniform Resource Locations) | Ex, https://www.mycompany.com | The World Wide Web (WWW) is this network of linked data and programs, running over the Internet | . | DNS - Domain Name Service Applications that translate a human readable URL (e.g. www.mycompany.com) to an IP address | DNS holds a database of mapping of names to IPs. Servers running DNS are spread across the internet | There are large computers serving and managing these name/IP Mappings for each Domain (.com, .net, .gov, etc.) | You use a DNS server every time you ask for a web page on a browser | . | . . Scalibility of the Internet . The scalability of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands. | The Internet was designed to be scalable Able to change in size and scale to meet new demands | . | Local Area Network (LAN): Physical Connections | Limited by hardware and physics | 1 to 100s of systems | . | Intranet: LANs connected by Routers within an organization | . | Autonomous Systems (AS): Large intranets linked together under the control and policies of major organizations. Large routers link networks with large telecommunications connections | . | The Internet: Autonomous Systems linked together | Large Routers linking Ass via special telecom means (Fiber, T3, Satellites) | Major infrastructures - DNS (.com, .net, etc.), Cyber Operations | . | . . Authentication . Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access. Ex: Strong passwords | Multifactor authentication. | . | A strong passwrod is something that is easy for a user to remember, but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user. | Multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the following categories: knowledge (something they know) | possession (something they have) | ingerence (something they are) | . | Multifactor authentication requires a least two steps to unlock protected information; each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain unauthorized access. | . . Encryption . Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access | Decryption: the process of decoding the data. | Two common encryption approaches are: Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption | Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver’s private key is required to decrypt the message | . | . | Certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validates the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model. | . . Viruses and Malware . Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection. | A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer. | Malware is software intended to damage a computing system or to take partial control over its operation. Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attachign itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment | . | Virus scans can help to prevent malicious code from getting into and affecting your system | . . Prevention . All real-world systems have errors or design flaws that can be exploited to compromise them. Regular software updates help fix errors that could compromise a computing system. | Users can control the permissions programs they have for collecting user information. Users should review the permission settings of programs to protect their privacy. | . . Quiz Results . .",

What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times for t, k in menu.items(): item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) if item == &quot;break&quot;: break total = total + menu[item] print(&quot;Total is: $&quot; + str(total)) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user .

Some errors that might arise in our project are: Our notes don&#39;t save | Only one note saves at a time | Storing notes/inputs for a specific user | . | Some test cases that can be used are testing user input and/or how output is displayed. We can also put in random notes and see if the questions that appear are relevant to the notes. We can also check if the answers are correct to their respective question. | We will document any bugs we encounter on our scrum board and/or slack. We can also put possible solutions on them as well. | Some single tests are putting in a random note on a random subject and checking that the note is saved, and the questions and answers are correct and relevant. |",

The following phrases are commonly used when developing a program: Investigating and refleting | Designing | Prototyping | Testing | . | A development process that is iterative requires refinement and revision based on feedback, testing, or reflection throughout the process. This may require revisiting earlier phrases of the process. | A development proess that is incremental is one that breaks the problem into smaller pieces and makes sure each piece works before adding it to the whole. | The design of a program incorporates investigation to determine its requirements. | Investigation in a development process is useful for understanding and identifying the program constraints, as well as the concerns and interests of the people who will use the program. | Some ways investigation can be performed are as follows: Collecting data through surveys | User testing | Inteviews | Direct observations | . | Program requirements describes how a program functions and may include a description of user interactions that a program must provide | . . How is a Program Developed? . Rarely a solo endeavor . Usually developed by teams of people It all starts with an idea | Programs are developed with a specific purpose in mind | Developers follow specific steps and stick to their plan | Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens (both good and bad) Think about early AI projects, like personal assistants Developers start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect | . | Investigation is an important step in the process | Developers must: Determine the requirements of the program | Understand the constraints | Understand the user concerns and interests | . | How do developers investigate?

Me and my team reviewed over the different possible final project ideas that we made and this is the best one we came up with. . . Outline and how it fits requirements . Program Purpose and Function -The purpose of the program is to randomly generate questions based on a user’s notes of key terms/dates/ideas and definitions. The program will take the user’s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the quiz. | . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. | . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. | . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. | . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user’s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. | . .

PBL - Project Based Learning is an inquiry-based instructional approach, in a real-world context, where students generate the pathways and products that meet defined, standards-based outcomes | Project - Time frame in which your culminating product is developed through workshops and deliverables | Culminating Project - Compilation of deliverables derived from the Deconstructed TEKS that come together to create a final presentation/demonstration of what was learned throughout the project | Driving Questions - Helps to initiate and focus the inquiry. It also captures and communicates the purpose of the project in a succinct question. It creates interest and a feeling of challenge. It guides the project work. It helps student answer the question: “Why are we doing this?” | Enduring Understanding - Refers to the important ideas or CORE processes that are central to a discipline and transferable to new situations and that have lasting value BEYOND the classroom… Learning should be measured in YEARS. “30 hours vs. 30 days vs. 30 years” | Entry Launch - The engaging activity that kickstarts your PBL. | Entry Document - The document used to drive the project, connect the TEKS to the idea, and develop the KNOW/K2K. Can be delivered in multiple formats. | Checkpoints - Scheduled mini-presentations held throughout the project to allow for formative assessment, positive &amp; negative feedback, whole group collaboration, accountability, speaking practice, and progression toward project completion. These develop 21st Century Skills and reinforce the focus on the enduring understanding, driving question, and culminating product. | Facilitating Questions - Appropriate way that teachers use to guide students toward the enduring understanding/deliverable/goal, redirect students, “pull out” content vocabulary, or help students make connections (conceptual, cross-discipline, relevance, value). Open ended is most effective, but close ended, probing techniques are acceptable for scaffolding. | Workshops - Planned lessons that are listed for students in a checklist or added assessments indicate. Commonly held in small groups to meet the need of the student(s) or group(s). | Deliverable - “End result” or goal of a workshop that will directly be used for the realization of the culminating product. It can be knowledge, but it is typically something that will be presented, built upon, or used to achieve the project’s desired result. | .",

Save notes in the website and the alogrithm uses the notes to genrate questions for a quiz. The quiz is then scored and the topics missed are highlighted | . Collegeboard Requirements . Program Purpose and Function . The purpose of the program is to randomly generate questions based on a user&#39;s notes of key terms/dates/ideas and definitions. The program will take the user&#39;s notes and, based on it, select the key terms and output multiple quiz questions which will be displayed randomly. It will score the quiz and tell you what you got wrong and what you need to study on. . Data Abstraction . The program will contain lists and dictionaries. Every key term will have a definition and these will be stored in a dictionary which will be stored in a list. Or they will be stored in a local database and we will use the objects in the database to create the quiz. . Managing Complexity . The dictionaries and databases will manage the complexity of the program by organizing the data inputted by the user. It will also help calling back to create the quiz. . Procedural Abstraction . A function will be created to call back to the data inputted by the user. The function will iterate over the dictionary/database and use the values in them as a parameter to make a quiz. . Algorithm Implementation . Like stated before, the program will contain a function that uses iteration and sequencing to make a quiz based off the data inputted by the user that is saved in a database or dictionary. . Testing . The function will be called each time the user inputs a note and each time the user generates a quiz. When the user inputs a note, the function is called and saves the note inside a dictionary or database. When the user presses the button that generates the quiz, the function is again called and iterates through the user&#39;s notes to generate a quiz that is related to the key terms the user inputted. .",

For Loops and Index . Using for loops and iterating through using index in python. In this simple example, I created a list of car brands and then I used a for loop to iterate through it. Then, I printed all the values that I iterated through. . Car_Brands = [&quot;Honda&quot;, &quot;Hyundai&quot;, &quot;Kia&quot;, &quot;Tesla&quot;, &quot;Lamborghini&quot;, &quot;Ferrari&quot;, &quot;Bugatti&quot;, &quot;Toyota&quot;, &quot;Porsche&quot;, &quot;Mustang&quot;, &quot;BMW&quot;, &quot;Mercedes&quot;] # Using a for loop to iterate through list for i in Car_Brands: print(i) # printing all the values . Honda Hyundai Kia Tesla Lamborghini Ferrari Bugatti Toyota Porsche Mustang BMW Mercedes . Outputting in Reverse Order . It is possible to output data in a reverse order. In this example, I determine if an inputted word is a palindrome. I first iterate through the inputted word the opposite way, or reverse order, and then if the reversed order is equal to the regular order, then I output that the word is a palindrome. If not, then I say the inputted word is not a palindrome. . def is_palindrome(prompt): print(prompt[::-1]) # iterates through the word in the reverse order print(prompt) return prompt[::-1] == prompt # returns if the reverse order is the same as the regular order word = input(&quot;Enter a word: &quot;) if is_palindrome(word.lower()) is True: # If the reverse is the same as regular print(&quot;{0} is a palindrome!&quot;.format(word)) else: print(&quot;The provided word is not a palindrome.&quot;) . eyb bye The provided word is not a palindrome. . Other list methods . Lists can have a variety of methods performed on them. A couple being .append() or while loop. In this example, I use .append() and .lower() with a for loop. I first make a list that I add dangerous animals. Then, I append another value. I made sure to make all the inputs have weird capitalization. Then, I terated through the range of the length of the list. I also made all the list values lowercase and then I printed all the values. . Dangerous_Animals = [&quot;Box Jellyfish&quot;, &quot;African CAPE BuFfalo&quot;, &quot;BLAck MambA&quot;, &quot;Blue-RINGED octopus&quot;] # made a list with dangerous animals, has weird capitalization Dangerous_Animals.append(&quot;Cone SnAIl&quot;) # added a new list value for i in range(len(Dangerous_Animals)): # iterates through the range of the length of the list Dangerous_Animals[i] = Dangerous_Animals[i].lower() # made all the values lowercase print(Dangerous_Animals) . [&#39;box jellyfish&#39;, &#39;african cape buffalo&#39;, &#39;black mamba&#39;, &#39;blue-ringed octopus&#39;, &#39;cone snail&#39;] . Using While Loop . While loops can also be used with a list. In this example, I used the same list as before. Then, I defined i as 0. Then I used a while loop so that while i was less than the length of the list, the output was equal to the list at index of i. I printed the output and I incremented i by 1 each time. . Dangerous_Animals = [&quot;Box Jellyfish&quot;, &quot;African Cape Buffalo&quot;, &quot;Black Mamba&quot;, &quot;Blue-ringed Octopus&quot;] # used the same list as before i = 0 # defined a variable, i while i &lt; len(Dangerous_Animals): # only runs while i is less than the length of the list output = Dangerous_Animals[i] # output equals each value when the list is at index of i print(output) i += 1 # increments i by 1 each time . Box Jellyfish African Cape Buffalo Black Mamba Blue-ringed Octopus . Adding to a Dictionary . You can also add or create new keys and values to a dictionary data set. This can also be done with input. In the example, I first created a dictionary with pokemon names as the keys and their type as values. I then added a new key and value and I also used input to add a new value and new key. . My_Dict = { &quot;Pikachu&quot;: &quot;Electric-type&quot;, &quot;Charizard&quot;: &quot;Fire-type&quot;, &quot;Blastoise&quot;: &quot;Water-type&quot;, &quot;Venusaur&quot;: &quot;Grass-type&quot;, &quot;Snorlax&quot;: &quot;Normal-type&quot;, &quot;Garchomp&quot;: &quot;Dragon-type&quot;, &quot;Lucario&quot;: &quot;Fighting-type&quot;, &quot;Darkrai&quot;: &quot;Dark-type&quot;, &quot;Arceus&quot;: &quot;Normal-type&quot;, } # defined a new dictionary print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Reshiram&quot;] = &quot;Dragon-type&quot; #Added new key and value into dictionary print(My_Dict) My_Dict[&quot;Articuno&quot;] = input() # Added new value with input print(My_Dict) . {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;} {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Reshiram&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;} {&#39;Pikachu&#39;: &#39;Electric-type&#39;, &#39;Charizard&#39;: &#39;Fire-type&#39;, &#39;Blastoise&#39;: &#39;Water-type&#39;, &#39;Venusaur&#39;: &#39;Grass-type&#39;, &#39;Snorlax&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Garchomp&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Lucario&#39;: &#39;Fighting-type&#39;, &#39;Darkrai&#39;: &#39;Dark-type&#39;, &#39;Arceus&#39;: &#39;Normal-type&#39;, &#39;Reshiram&#39;: &#39;Dragon-type&#39;, &#39;Articuno&#39;: &#39;Ice-type&#39;} . Python Quiz . I made a quiz using the InfoDb, list of dictionary. In this example, I defined a function with prompt as a parameter. I also defined a variable word, so that it was equal to the user&#39;s input. I also added 2 new variables, that defined the number of correct answers and the number of questions. I then printed a short intro that said &quot;Hello, you will be asked (the amount of questions) short questions.&quot; I then made a list of dictionaries (InfoDb) with the questions as the keys and the answers as the values. I then used a for loop to iterate through all the dictionary keys and values. If the word (user&#39;s input) for each question was equal to its respectable answer, then it printed &quot;Answer is correct&quot; and added the number of correct answers by 1. If the word wasn&#39;t equal, then an incorrect answer resopnse was pinted. At the end, I printed the amount of questions the user got correct out of the total questions. . def Python_Quiz(prompt): # Defines function that takes &#39;prompt&#39; as a parameter global word # so that word can be called outside function print (&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) # setup for each question word = input() # the variable word is the user&#39;s input return word questions_number = 5 correct_answer = 0 # 2 variables for the number of questions and number of correct answers print(&quot;Hello, you will be asked &quot; + str(questions_number) + &quot; short questions&quot;) # short intro My_Quiz = [{ &quot;What is the answer to this math problem: What is f(4) if f(x) = 3x/x-3&quot;: &quot;12&quot;, &quot;What is the most popular religion in the world?&quot;: &quot;Christianity&quot;, &quot;What is the capital of the U.S?&quot;: &quot;Washington D.C.&quot;, &quot;What is the molar mass of Carbon-12?&quot;: &quot;12 g&quot;, &quot;How many moles of water are in a 3.0 gram sample?&quot;: &quot;0.17&quot;, }] # makes a list of dictionaries with questions as the keys and the answers as the values for dict in My_Quiz: # for all dictionary stuff in the InfoDb for questions, answers in dict.items(): # both keys and values Python_Quiz(questions) # the prompt is the questions if word == answers: # if the user&#39;s answer is equal to the correct answer print(&quot;Answer is correct&quot;) correct_answer += 1 else: print(&quot;Answer is incorrect&quot;) print(&quot;You scored &quot; + str(correct_answer) + &quot;/&quot; + str(questions_number)) # prints how many correct answers out of total questions .

Answer is correct Question: How many moles of water are in a 3.0 gram sample? Answer is correct You scored 4/5 . Explanation . Inside the function: I defined the function Python_Quiz, I made a variable &quot;word&quot; and I also made it so that every question started with the format &quot;Question:&quot;. I defined the variable &quot;word&quot; so that it was equal to the input of the user. I also made the variable global so that it could be called outside of the function. . Outside the function: I made 2 new variables &quot;questions&quot;, and &quot;correct_answer&quot; which is later used to say the amount of question and correct answers. I then introduce the quiz by saying that the user will be asked 5 questions. For extra credit, I used lists and iterations to make a question list and an answer list. Then I used index (i) to make it so that if the user&#39;s answer was equal to the corresponding answer_list answer, then a correct answer response was given. If the answer that the user gave did not match the corresponding answer_list answer, then an incorrct answer response was given. I then also told the user how many correct answers they got out of the total amount of questions. .",

Artemia (brine shrimp) is a genus of very small anostracan crustaceans found in saline habitats. They are distantly related to a number of other small to microscopic crustaceans - Triops (Notostraca), water fleas (Cladocera), and clam shrimp (‘Conchostraca’). . Description . Artemia and other Anostraca are generally elongated, with an anatomy somewhat ‘generic’ among crustaceans, though they have only 1 pair of well-developed antennae. . | They utilize 11 pairs of thoracic legs and a set of ‘flukes’ on their tails to swim, which they do upside-down. . | To feed, they may scrape organic material from available surfaces or filter particles from the water. . | . Common food source for birds, certain insects, fishes, and larger crustaceans . | Maximum length of just over 1cm . | Healthiest food for them is the microscopic algae Dunaliella viridis . | As passive filter feeders, brine shrimp collect whatever is in the water and sweep it into their mouths . | Brine shrimp may become dormant in cysts in order to resist extreme environmental conditions until the environment becomes more favorable. . | . Life Cycle . Brine shrimp start out as cysts until the water warms, after which they become larvae (nauplii) .

The survival of organisms in the wild is often affected by various environmental abiotic factors. In the case of the anostracan Artemia salina, these include a water temperature of 25°C, a pH of 8.1, minimal water movement, &lt;20 mPa of pressure and high (≤50%) salinity. A. salina is generally found at low depths and presumably requires relatively high oxygen levels and normal light/dark cycling. A. salina is highly vulnerable to poisoning by metallic elements and all life stages are killed by ionizing radiation. . Problem . What will be the effect of different acidity levels within the surrounding environment on the development of the brine shrimp? . Hypothesis and Experimental Setup . This experiment investigated the effects of modulating pH on A. salina nauplii survival rates. The null hypothesis is: “Addition of sulfuric acid to water will not affect the proportion of surviving brine shrimp.” The alternative hypothesis is: “If sulfuric acid is added to water to make it more acidic, then the proportion of brine shrimp that survive over the course of the experiment will decrease.” . There were three petri dishes making up three experimental groups. Each petri dish was filled with saltwater with brine shrimp. The groups are as follows: a control group in which no acid was added to the saltwater, a treatment group with a water pH of 7, and a treatment group with a water pH of 6. Sulfuric acid was added to the treatment groups to decrease pH, and as such, the amount of pH was the independent variable. During the experiment, the number of brine shrimp dead and alive was measured over 24-hour intervals to reflect a dependent variable of brine shrimp viability . Materials and Procedures . To conduct an experiment to test these hypotheses, the following materials were gathered: . Salt based water (50 mL) in a large container . | 3 Petri Dishes . | Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4) . | Brine Shrimp . | Sharpies . | Masking tape . | Three 50 mL beakers . | 10 mL graduated cylinder . | Pipette . | Shoebin with brine shrimp and salt-based water . | Light source . | . Using these materials, the following procedure was followed: . 1) &gt; 3 petri dishes were labeled with masking tape and a sharpie as “Control pH = 8”, ‘“Experimental group #1 pH = 7”, and “Experimental group #2 pH = 6”. The appropriate identification of all three petri dishes was also labeled(in this case, Table 5 Period 4) . 2) &gt; A 50 mL beaker was used to scoop saltwater out of a larger container. 30 mL of saltwater was measured out using the 10 mL graduated cylinder and added to each petri dish. . 3) &gt; Sulfuric acid was added to each petri dish until the pH of the two treatment groups were in correspondence with their assigned labels. . 4) &gt; A 50 mL beaker was used to scoop from the shoebin with brine shrimp, and was exposed to light. . 5) &gt; A pipette was used to transfer brine shrimp from the beaker into another beaker to reduce the volume of eggs. . 6) &gt; A pipette was used to squirt brine shrimp into each petri dish from the container. . 7) &gt; The number in each petri dish of brine shrimp was counted and recorded; a light on each petri dish while counting to clearly see the shrimp. Record this in the data table. . 8) &gt; Return to the petri dishes 24 hours and 48 hours after they were set up. Count the number of live and dead brine shrimp in each petri dish; shine a light on each petri dish while counting to clearly see the shrimp. . Constants . It is important to ensure only the independent variable changes during an experiment, in this case, the pH of water in each petri dish. All other variables must be controlled. Some constants include the water temperature, which remained constant as the petri dishes were kept within an air-conditioned classroom and stored in the same shelf when not in use. In addition, the time intervals between the groups were kept consistent; this includes the time of day each experimental group was set up and the time of day data was collected from each group (both of which were either near 12:00 or 12:30), as well as the length of time that data was collected (over two days). Finally, the salinity of the water in each petri dish was kept constant, given that the water was derived from the same two containers (one with saltwater and one with brine shrimp). . Data . Table 1: Brine Shrimp Viability .     0 hours   24 hours   48 hours   . Dish # | pH | Alive | Dead | Alive | Dead | Alive | Dead | . 1 | 8 | 10 | 0 | 15 | 0 | 12 | 2 | . 2 | 7 | 11 | 0 | 18 | 2 | 9 | 4 | . 3 | 6 | 10 | 0 | 17 | 1 | 17 | 3 | . . Discussion and Conclusions . Conclusive results cannot be drawn due to a number of confounding factors. Some of these include brine shrimp eggs that were placed in the petri dishes along with the live brine shrimp. A number of eggs hatched during the period between the first two data collections, resulting in an increase in the number of brine shrimp in each setup. In addition, some individuals observed during the second data collection were not found, alive or dead, in the third (one in the control and 7 in the pH 7 setup). All data collection was done manually in periods of 5 minutes each, likely resulting in random error. . If a future experiment were conducted, more accurate results can be achieved by implementing an automatic counting system and extracting only hatched brine shrimp from the original holding container. A repetition of the experiment with the changes made above would be helpful in taking data leading to conclusive results. Consideration of further research avenues may proceed following the procurement of genuine results. . Works Cited . Artemia salina, https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Artemia_salina/.

          "content": ". . This year’s vocabulary includes: . Trimester 1 . Function - A group of related statements that perform a specific task | Def - The command to define a function | Parameter - Variables for the values the function needs. Is passed as an argument when the function is called | Variable - A way of storing values into the memory of the computer by using specific names that you define | List - A “container” that can store any kinds of values | Repository - A location where all the files for a particular project are stored | String - A series of readable or usable sentences that the user will use | len() - Returns the length (the number of items) of an object | Return - Used to return from a function (break out of the function) | . Trimester 2 . Bits - Smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store | Bytes - A unit of data that is eight binary digits long | Hexadecimal - A numbering system with base 16 | Binary Numbers - A numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit – 0 or 1 : Unsigned Integer - Just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don’t have a + or - sign associated with them | Signed Integer - Represent both positive and negative numbers | Floating Point - A positive or negative whole number with a decimal point | . | Binary Data Abstractions - Reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole: Boolean - A logical data type that can have only the values true or false | ASCII - The most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet | Unicode - Universal character representation standard for text in computer processing | RGB - A system for representing the colors to be used on a computer display | . | Data Compression - the process of encoding, restructuring or otherwise modifying data in order to reduce its size: Lossy - the data in a file is removed and not restored to its original form after decompression | Lossless - restores and rebuilds file data in its original form after the file is decompressed | . | Variable - A value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program | Data types - A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error | Assignment Operation - The operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element | Managing Complexity with Variables - Establishes a level of complexity on which a person interacts with the system, suppressing the more complex details below the current level: Lists - abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once | 2D Lists - collection of data cells, all of the same type, which can be given a single name | Dictionaries - an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs | Class - template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object | Algorithms - a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation | Sequence - the order in which the statements are executed | Selection - a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met | Iteration - a process where the design of a product or application is improved by repeated review and testing | Expressions - a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value | Comparison Operators - used to compare the values within an expression, such as to check if the value held by a variable matches the value held by another variable | Booleans Expressions and Selection - a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE and can be selected | Booleans Expressions and Iteration - a logical statement that is either TRUE or FALSE where a process can be repeated | Truth Tables - a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit | Characters - a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol | Strings - a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable | Length - The length of a data type, can be number of characters or number of data | Concatenation - the operation of joining two strings together | Upper - Uppercase characters | Lower - Lowercase characters | Traversing Strings - accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript | Python If, Elif, Else conditionals - expressions that evaluate to either true or false | Nested Selection Statements - used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task | Python For, While loops with Range, with List - a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached | Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue - Conditionals that occur while a specific process is being repeated - can be stopped or passed | Procedural Abstraction - when we write code sections which are generalised by having variable parameters | Python Def procedures - A procedure allows us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name | Parameters - a special kind of variable used in a function to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the function | Return Values - ends the execution of a function, and returns control to the calling function | . | .",
