<ul>
  <li>Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks.</li>
  <li>Algorithms that look similar often yield differnet outputs.</li>
  <li>Many different algorithms can be use to solve the same problem</li>
  <li>Algorithms are very important for programmers</li>
  <li>Conditionals and booleans can be equivalent.</li>
  <li>If and for loops will be used for selection and iteration</li>
  <li>A subnet mask is a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address is in through a process that uses the bitwise AND</li>
  <li>An IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device.</li>
  <li>Searching is finding and retrieving a data value and/or index</li>
  <li>Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each.</li>
  <li>The most obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed.
    <ul>
      <li>Using some sort of loop, generally for or while loop</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sequential search, however, is not efficient when testing large data inputs
    <ul>
      <li>Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm’s overall runtime increases “linearly” with the input size.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value.</li>
</ul>
