<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Question #</th>
      <th>Why I missed/Struggles</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>21</td>
      <td>I didn’t look at the program code segment properly. The loop never ends because the loop can only end when a variable equals 4. But, each time, as the variable is increased by 1, the loop defines the variable as 1 in the beginning. This causes the loop to keep going.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>I got this question wrong because I didn’t fully understand the code segment or the function. I also didn’t look carefully at the order of the code, which led to the incorrect answer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>42</td>
      <td>I got this answer wrong because I didn’t fully understand computer simulations. I didn’t realize that they could be used to present designs to customers, I only thought that they were used within companies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>45</td>
      <td>I didn’t fully understand the definition of a heuristic approach. I thought they were only used when the problem could be solved in a reasonable time, but they actually should be used when the problem cannot be solved in reasonable time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>47</td>
      <td>I also missed this problem because I didn’t really understand heuristic approaches and its uses. I thought its best used for simple problems, so I thought that a program that sorts numbers in order was good for heuristic approach. In reality, finding the shortest driving route between two locations was the best program to use a heuristic approach.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>50</td>
      <td>I missed this question because I didn’t know how to convert hexadecimal to decimal. I knew that hexadecimal mean base 16, but I could’t convert hexadecimal 56 into decimal.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Ultimately, I missed questions near the end because my focus dwindled and I wasn’t able to fully read the question properly.</p>
