<p>Night at the Museum takes place one night near the end of the trimester where students in art and craft classes can show off their progress and work. Classes include 3D Animation, AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, Ceramics, CSP, CSA, and more. In CSP and CSA, teams present their final project, while in drawing and painting, students show off their best artpieces. 3D Animation students also present their digital artworks while ceramics students present their sculptures. During this night, all the art students can gather and have fun as they survey all the artworks.</p>

<p>Here are a few screenshots of artworks in 3D Animation.

As I have already taken this course, I know how the class works and what the curriculum is. But, I still get exposed to new ideas and creative inventions.</p>

I have never been the best at drawing, so I was fascinated by how the artists managed to make their artwork look realistic, and used shading to create a sense of three-dimensional space.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of artworks in Ceramics.

I have never even done Ceramics before, so I have no idea how students mold their clay and then dry them into a sculpture as shown above.</p>
