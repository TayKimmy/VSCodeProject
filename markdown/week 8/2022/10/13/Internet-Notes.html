<h3 id="packets">
<a class="anchor" href="#packets" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Packets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network. Each packet also includes the source and the destination information.</li>
  <li>Packet Switching:
    <ul>
      <li>The message (file) is broken up into packets and sent in any order. The packets are reassembled by the recipient’s device. Ex:
        <ul>
          <li>Hello. How are you? ==&gt;</li>
          <li>Hello.    You?     How are</li>

<h3 id="the-internet">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-internet" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Internet</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Internet is a computer network consisting of interconnected networks that use standardized, open (nonpropritary) communication protocols.</li>
  <li>Access to the Internet depends on the ability to connact a computing dvice to an internet connected device.</li>
  <li>Routing on the Internet is usually dynamic; it is not specified in advance</li>
  <li>Information is passed through the Internet as a data stream. Data streams contain chunks of data, which are encapsulated in packets</li>
  <li>Packets contain a chunk of data and metadata used for routing the packet between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly</li>
  <li>Packets may arrive at the destination in order, our of order, or not at all</li>
  <li>The World Wide Web is a system of linked pages, programs, and files</li>
  <li>The World Wide Web uses the Internet</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="protocols">
<a class="anchor" href="#protocols" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Protocols</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A protocol is an agreed-upon set of rules that specify the behavior of a system.</li>
  <li>The protocols used in the Internet are open, which allows users to easily connect additional computing devices to the Internet.</li>
  <li>IP, TCP, and UDP are common protocols used on the Internet
    <ul>
      <li>TCP does error checking and error recovery so it is slower</li>
      <li>UDP performs error checking, but it discards erroneous packets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>HTTP is a protocol used by the World Wide Web</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="internet-and-transport-layers">
<a class="anchor" href="#internet-and-transport-layers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Internet and Transport Layers</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Transport Layer - How the packets are sent, and for what
    <ul>
      <li>Reliability - reliable - sender gets a receipt back, resend as needed
  TCP</li>
      <li>Unreliability - send and forget.
  UDP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Internet Layer
    <ul>
      <li>IPv4: Example 192.168.24.1
  32 bits, separated into 4 “octets”
  8 bits long (0-255)</li>
      <li>Separated into 2 parts:
        <ul>
          <li>Network (1-31)</li>
          <li>Device (32-network bits)</li>

<h3 id="application-layer">
<a class="anchor" href="#application-layer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Application Layer</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Key protocols used:
    <ul>
      <li>http. How to ask and receive data from web servers. Normally uses TCP, Port 80 at the transport layer</li>
      <li>https. Like http but with security. Usually uses TCP Port 443</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Web Servers:
    <ul>
      <li>Programs running on machines connected to the Internet</li>
      <li>Provides clients web pages - data linked to other pages using URLs (Uniform Resource Locations)</li>
      <li>Ex, https://www.mycompany.com</li>
      <li>The World Wide Web (WWW) is this network of linked data and programs, running over the Internet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>DNS - Domain Name Service
    <ul>
      <li>Applications that translate a human readable URL (e.g. www.mycompany.com) to an IP address</li>
      <li>DNS holds a database of mapping of names to IPs. Servers running DNS are spread across the internet</li>
      <li>There are large computers serving and managing these name/IP Mappings for each Domain (.com, .net, .gov, etc.)</li>
      <li>You use a DNS server every time you ask for a web page on a browser</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>The Internet was designed to be scalable
    <ul>
      <li>Able to change in size and scale to meet new demands</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3 id="authentication">
<a class="anchor" href="#authentication" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authentication</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Authentication measures protect devices and information from unauthorized access. Ex:
    <ul>
      <li>Strong passwords</li>
      <li>Multifactor authentication.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A strong passwrod is something that is easy for a user to remember, but would be difficult for someone else to guess based on knowledge of that user.</li>
  <li>Multifactor authentication is a method of computer access control in which a user is only granted access after successfully presenting several separate pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism, typically in at least two of the following categories:
    <ul>
      <li>knowledge (something they know)</li>
      <li>possession (something they have)</li>
      <li>ingerence (something they are)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multifactor authentication requires a least two steps to unlock protected information; each step adds a new layer of security that must be broken to gain unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="encryption">
<a class="anchor" href="#encryption" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Encryption</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Encryption: the process of encoding data to prevent unauthorized access</li>
  <li>Decryption: the process of decoding the data.</li>
  <li>Two common encryption approaches are:
    <ul>
      <li>Symmetric key encryption involves one key for both encryption and decryption</li>
      <li>Public key encryption pairs a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
        <ul>
          <li>The sender does not need the receiver’s private key to encrypt a message, but the receiver’s private key is required to decrypt the message</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Certificate authorities issue digital certificates that validates the ownership of encryption keys used in secure communications and are based on a trust model.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Computer virus and malware scanning software can help protect a computing system against infection.</li>
  <li>A computer virus is a malicious program that can copy itself and gain access to a computer in an unauthorized way. Computer viruses often attach themselves to legitimate programs and start running independently on a computer.</li>
  <li>Malware is software intended to damage a computing system or to take partial control over its operation.
    <ul>
      <li>Can infiltrate a system by posing as legitimate programs or by attachign itself to legitimate programs, like an email attachment</li>
