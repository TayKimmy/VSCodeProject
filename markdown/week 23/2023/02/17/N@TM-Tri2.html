<p>Night At The Museums - also abbreviated N@TM - is an event where fine arts students and computer science students can show off their artworks and projects. It takes place at Del Norte at the end of the trimester, and lasts one night. Classes that participate include AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, 3D Animations, CSP, CSA, Ceramics, Digital Media, and more. During the event, all the students, as well as their parents, are invited to come to have fun and look at other peoples’ achievements. The band also plays music outside for people to listen to.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed N@TM this trimester. I knew a lot of the people here - mainly from CSP - and I was able to have a lot of fun. I also showed off my project to other people - including the teacher - who gave insight on our project and possible improvements. I was able to see projects and artworks from other classes and I was amazed at how good some of they looked. For example, I really enjoyed looking at the arts in AP Studio Art because they were so realisitc and looked very good. I also liked looking at the ceramics because I didn’t really know how the they created those sculptures.</p>
