## Unit 2 Vocab
- Bits - Smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store
- Bytes - A unit of data that is eight binary digits long
- Hexadecimal - A numbering system with base 16
- Binary Numbers - A numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit -- 0 or 1 :
    - Unsigned Integer - Just like integers (whole numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them
    - Signed Integer - Represent both positive and negative numbers
    - Floating Point - A positive or negative whole number with a decimal point
- Binary Data Abstractions - Reduction of a particular body of data to a simplified representation of the whole:
    - Boolean - 
    - ASCII - 
    - Unicode - 
    - RGB - 
- Data Compression:
- Lossy
- Lossless

## Unit 3 Vocab
- Variable - A value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program
- Data types - A classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error
- Assignment Operation - The operator used to assign a new value to a variable, property, event or indexer element
- Managing Complexity with Variables:
    - Lists
    - 2D Lists
