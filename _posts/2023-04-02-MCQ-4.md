## Corrections
| Questions I missed | Why I missed it |
|-|-|
| Question 17 | I misclicked the right answer. I knew the answer was B but I somehow clicked C. |
| Question 27 | I got this question wrong because I thought all the other answer choices did not show lossless transformation. In reality, the others can be lossless if there is a way to revert back to the orginal, which is what the correct answer does. |
| Question 36 | I got this questions wrong because I was slightly confused with what heuristic meant. I thought the question was asking where a simple algorithm could be used but it was asking where a simple approach could be used for a very timeful problem. |
| Question 37 | I got this question wrong because I thought a quadratic time complexity was an unreasonable amount of time when it actually is reasonable. |
| Question 49 | I got this question wrong because the code segment I chose compares the first element to itself as well, always resulting in true. The correct code segment starts at index 2 and also accounts for the exception of index 1 by subtracting the length of the list by 1 as well. |
