Dopamine issues:
- Dopamine issues are real - Many kids are addicted to games or social media, and are always on either phones, computers, PCs, or gaming consoles.
- For a few kids, these issues impact their studying and success in High School
    - They can't focus in school
    - They don't do homework, and instead, play games and post on social media
    - Social media also creates stress as desire for likes and followers can create anxiety and depression
    - Gaming and social media can also lead to cyberbullying in toxic online communities
- These don't affect my personal studying and success in High School
    - Although I play games, I don't play as much as others and I am not addicted
    - I use few social media platforms, and mainly for texting. I don't care about followers, posts, or likes.

## Big Idea 5.2 - Digital Divide

Digital Empowerment:
- Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by gaining knowledge about devices and how they work
    - They can also buy devices such as TVs, phones, tablets, and computers (if the devices are affordable and available)
    - Not all people can empower themselves, though, because of multiple causes:
        1. They may not have the money to buy devices
        2. They may not have the opportunity to learn more about devices
        3. There may be nore available devices or learning because the place they live in is demoderinzed
- Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered in a multitude of ways:
    1. Buy them devices
    2. Give them opportunities to learn more about devices
    3. Give them financial/digital aid
    4. Teach them about devices and how to buy one
- At Del Norte, students can start fundraisers to raise money to buy devices - phones, computers, printers, etc. - for those who cannot afford them and do not have access to them on a regular basis
- There are barriers blocking digital empowerment:
    - Places such as Third World Countries generally do not have as much access to devices compared to countries like the U.S.
        - This is not just an issue of money, but availability and access
        - These place does not even have this type of technology nor are there opportunities for people to learn more about technology
    - Even in "rich" countries, barriers still block a few from digital empowerment:
        - Generally, these are issues of money
            - People don't have the money to buy devices or learn more about them
        - Often, there are other priorities for these people:
            - Rent, housing, food, jobs, tranportation
- There are such barriers in Del Norte, but not as apparent
    - There are a few kids who probably don't have the ability to buy devices because their parents do not earn enough money
