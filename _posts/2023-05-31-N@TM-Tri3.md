## What is N@TM
Night At The Museums, also known as N@TM, is a special event that showcases the artistic talents and projects of both fine arts and computer science students. It occurs at Del Norte towards the end of the trimester and spans a single night. Participating classes encompass a wide range, including AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, 3D Animations, CSP, CSA, Ceramics, Digital Media, and more. During this event, students and their parents are cordially invited to attend and enjoy the displays of other students' accomplishments. Additionally, there is live music played by a band outside, providing a pleasant ambiance for all attendees.

### My Insights
I had a wonderful experience at N@TM this trimester. Many of the familiar faces I encountered were from my CSP class, and I had a great time connecting with them. It was fulfilling to share my own project with others, including our teacher, who offered valuable insights and suggestions for improvement. Witnessing the projects and artworks from various classes left me astounded by their quality. For instance, the AP Studio Art displays were strikingly realistic and impressive. I also found the ceramics exhibits intriguing, as I was unfamiliar with the techniques behind creating those sculptures.
