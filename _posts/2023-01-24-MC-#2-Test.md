## What I missed

| Question # | Why I missed/Struggles |
|-|-|
| 21 | I didn't look at the program code segment properly. The loop never ends because the loop can only end when a variable equals 4. But, each time, as the variable is increased by 1, the loop defines the variable as 1 in the beginning. This causes the loop to keep going. |
| 30 | I got this question wrong because I didn't fully understand the code segment or the function. I also didn't look carefully at the order of the code, which led to the incorrect answer. |
| 42 | I got this answer wrong because I didn't fully understand computer simulations. I didn't realize that they could be used to present designs to customers, I only thought that they were used within companies. |
| 45 | I didn't fully understand the definition of a heuristic approach. I thought they were only used when the problem could be solved in a reasonable time, but they actually should be used when the problem cannot be solved in reasonable time. |
| 47 | I also missed this problem because I didn't really understand heuristic approaches and its uses. I thought its best used for simple problems, so I thought that a program that sorts numbers in order was good for heuristic approach. In reality, finding the shortest driving route between two locations was the best program to use a heuristic approach. |
| 50 | I missed this question because I didn't know how to convert hexadecimal to decimal. I knew that hexadecimal mean base 16, but I could't convert hexadecimal 56 into decimal. |

Ultimately, I missed questions near the end because my focus dwindled and I wasn't able to fully read the question properly.
