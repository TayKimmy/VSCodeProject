# First Week

## Submission 1

| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The written response does not define the program's functionality. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There are 2 code segments that shows a list and what the list does, as well as the name of the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | There is a list that is managing complexity but Collegeboard thinks that the list is not needed to manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows student-developed procedures that are called later on in the code, and describes what the procedure does. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Shows sequencing, selection, and iteration, and shows how the algorithm can be replicated easily. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls to the procedure, as well as the results for each call. The conditions are also described. |

## Submission 2

| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response describes the program's purpose and functionality, as well as the inputs and outputs of the program. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows code segments that include lists and describes what the lists do and names them. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Shows a program segment that includes a list that manages complexity and the user describes how. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows two program segments with one showing a procedure with at least one parameter that as called later on in the code |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Shows sequencing, selection, and iteration, and explains how the algorithm can be replicated by others. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls to the procedure in the previous questions that pass different arguments. The results are also described. |

# Second Week

## Submission 1

| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The response does talk about input and output, but they are switched. The purpose is also not described correctly |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response contains code segments but it does not actually show the list the respose talks about.|
| Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The response does not show a list managing complexity and the description does not explain either. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response does not describe how the procedure contributes to overall functionality. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | Sequencing, selection, and iteration is shown but the algorithm is not explained with detail. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | 2 calls are described with the conditions of each call, and the results of each call is described. |

## Submission 2
| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response and video shows the input and output of the program, and the purpose and functionality of the program is also defined. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response contains code segments that shows that data is being stored and the list is also shown being used. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | A list is shown being used, it is shown managing complexity, and the response describes how the list manages complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There are 2 program code segments that shows a student-created procedure that is being called later on, with description of the procedure. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The algorithm shows sequencing, selection, and iteration, and the purpose of the algorithm is explained. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The response talks about 2 calls of the function with the conditions and results of each call. |

## Submission 3
| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The response and video shows the input and output of the program, and the functionality is defined but the program purpose is not described. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The response shows 2 code segments with data being stored and used, along with the name of the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | A list is shown being used to manage complexity and the name of the list is given. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There are 2 program code segments that contains a student-created procedure and the response describes the procedure and how its called. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The algorithm is described with enough detail to be replicated and it shows sequencing, selection, and iteration. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | The response contains 2 calls and describes the results, conditions, and call themselves. |
