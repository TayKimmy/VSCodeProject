# First Week

## Submission 1

| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The written response does not define the program's functionality. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There are 2 code segments that shows a list and what the list does, as well as the name of the list. |
| ***Managing Complexity*** | 1 | 0 | There is a list that is managing complexity but Collegeboard thinks that the list is not needed to manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows student-developed procedures that are called later on in the code, and describes what the procedure does. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Shows sequencing, selection, and iteration, and shows how the algorithm can be replicated easily. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls to the procedure, as well as the results for each call. The conditions are also described. |

|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response defines the program purpose and functionality, while both the response and video show input/output. |

## Submission 3

| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response describes the program purpose and both response and video shows inputs and outputs. |
| Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The response contains code segments that the second segment shows the data being stored, and neither show the data being used. |

| Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | There are 2 program code segments that shows a student-created procedure but there are no parameters and the description is inaccurate. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The algorithm shows sequencing, selection but there is no iteration and the description is inaccurate. |
| Testing | 0 | 0 | The response talks about calls from the procedure, not to the procedure, and the results are not specified. |
