## Submission 1
| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 0 | The written response does not define the program's functionality. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | There are 2 code segments that shows a list and what the list does, as well as the name of the list. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 0 | There is a list that is managing complexity but Collegeboard thinks that the list is not needed to manage complexity. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows student-developed procedures that are called later on in the code, and describes what the procedure does. |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Shows sequencing, selection, and iteration, and shows how the algorithm can be replicated easily. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls to the procedure, as well as the results for each call. The conditions are also described. |

## Submission 2
| Category | Student Score | Collegeboard Score | Comments |
|-|-|-|-|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The response describes the program's purpose and functionality, as well as the inputs and outputs of the program. |
| Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows code segments that include lists and describes what the lists do and names them. |
| Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | Shows a program segment that includes a list that manages complexity and the user describes how. |
| Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | Shows two program segments with one showing a procedure with at least one parameter that as called later on in the code |
| Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | Shows sequencing, selection, and iteration, and explains how the algorithm can be replicated by others. |
| Testing | 1 | 1 | Describes two calls to the procedure in the previous questions that pass different arguments. The results are also described. |
