## Why is collaboration important?
- Computing innovations are improved through collaboration
- Collaboration improves interpersonal skills

---

## Benefits of collaboration

### Computing innovations
- Effective collaboration produces innovations that reflect the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it
- Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias when developing computing innovations

---

#### What are computing innovations
- A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function
- A computing innovation can be physical (self-driving car), nonphysical computing software (picture editing software), or a nonphysical computing concept (e-commerce).

---

### Interpersonal Skills
Effective collaboration leads to the practice of interpersonal skills, such as:
  - Communication
  - Consensus Building
  - Conflict Resolution
  - Negotiation

### Results of effective collaboration
- Many major apps such as Facebook and Instagram were made through effective collaboration
- Famous games such as Super Mario 2 and 3 were also made through effect collaboration

## Collaboration in AP CSP

### Essential Knowledge
- Consultation and communcation with users are important aspects of the development of computing innovations
- Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives
- Online tools support collaboration by allowing programmers to share and provide feedback on ideas and documents
- Common models such as pair programming exist to facilitate collaboration

### How to collaborate in class

Pair Programming
- Two programmers work together as a pair. One (driver)writes program code, while the other (oberserver, pointer, navigator) reviews each line of program code

Think-Pair-Share
- Students think through a problem alone, pair with a partner to share ideas, and then share results with the class

---

### Purpose of comments in code
- Communicate to you partner(s)
- Communicate to yourself
- Acknowledge code segments used from other sources
- Acknowledge media used from other sources
- Differentiate what you and your partner(s) did
- Clarify the functionality of your code

---

### Online collaboration tools for class
- Repl.it - multiplayer, multiple languages
- GitHub - collaboration and repository
- Shared document or folder - share code
