## Missed Questions

| Question # | Why I got it wrong |
| - | - |
| 15 | I got this question wrong because I didn't properly read the code segments and I didn't really examine the graph. |
| 23 | I didn't fully understand the Internet. The Internet is designed to support an increasing number of users. It is not centralized, has open communication protocols (nonproprietary), and does not require encryption. |
| 36 | I got this question wrong because I didn't read the question carefully and I thought that all personal information on the INternet was stored using authentication measures. Much information is not stored with authentication. |
| 43 | I didn't know what keylogging was. I thought it was related to encryption with keys, but it is actually using a program to record which keys are hit on a computer. |
| 44 | I was being careless in this question. The question talked about imprecise values, which is not an overflow error. Since unlimited number of bits are impossible, the answer has to be round-off error with a fixed number of bits. |
| 53 | I was being dumb in this question and I didn't properly read the answer choices. I only focused on the second part, not the first. |
| 66 | I got this question wrong because I didn't  read the code segments properly and I didn't test the if statements with my own numbers. I have to make sure to pay attention to the inequality symbols. |
| 68 | I didn't understand the code segment. The code only removes duplicate numbers when they are right next to each other. That is why answers A and C result in duplicated numbers because the same numbers are spread out, so the program does not work. |
