**Brine Shrimp Research Facts**

**Taxonomy**

*Artemia* (brine shrimp) is a genus of very small anostracan crustaceans found in saline habitats. They are distantly related to a number of other small to microscopic crustaceans - *Triops* (Notostraca), water fleas (Cladocera), and clam shrimp (‘Conchostraca’).

**Description**

  - > *Artemia* and other Anostraca are generally elongated, with an anatomy somewhat ‘generic’ among crustaceans, though they have only 1 pair of well-developed antennae.

  - > They utilize 11 pairs of thoracic legs and a set of ‘flukes’ on their tails to swim, which they do upside-down.

  - > To feed, they may scrape organic material from available surfaces or filter particles from the water.

<!-- end list -->

  - > Common food source for birds, certain insects, fishes, and larger crustaceans

  - > Maximum length of just over 1cm

  - > Healthiest food for them is the microscopic algae *Dunaliella viridis*

  - > As passive filter feeders, brine shrimp collect whatever is in the water and sweep it into their mouths

  - > Brine shrimp may become dormant in cysts in order to resist extreme environmental conditions until the environment becomes more favorable.

**Life Cycle**

  - > Brine shrimp start out as cysts until the water warms, after which they become larvae (nauplii)
    
      - > These cysts may remain dormant for as long as 25 years.

  - > Brine shrimp make new exoskeletons and molt old ones at various stages of growth

  - > It may take 8 days for brine shrimp to mature under ideal conditions, and around 3-6 weeks under natural conditions

  - > Females release different offspring under different conditions. If conditions are favorable, they release eggs that develop immediately into larvae, and if conditions are unfavorable, they release cysts.

**Habitat & Conditions:**

  - > Found in saline inland bodies of water, including salt swamps, lakes, and evaporation ponds, but never in the open ocean

  - > Able to live in salinity ranging from 2.9% to 50%

  - > Thrives in water temperatures of 6 to 37 degrees celsius, optimal reproduction temperature at 25 degrees celsius

  - > The salinity of water affects the types of microbes that are available from them to eat

**Other facts:**

  - > Often found swimming “upside-down” with appendages facing upwards due to positive phototaxis
    
      - > Often rise to the surface of the water during the day and sink at night

  - > Brine shrimp color may be affected by diet and the environment.

  - > Brine shrimps are often used to test the toxicity of certain substances.

> **Introduction**

The survival of organisms in the wild is often affected by various environmental abiotic factors. In the case of the anostracan *Artemia salina*, these include a water temperature of 25°C, a pH of 8.1, minimal water movement, \<20 mPa of pressure and high (≤50%) salinity. *A. salina* is generally found at low depths and presumably requires relatively high oxygen levels and normal light/dark cycling. *A. salina* is highly vulnerable to poisoning by metallic elements and all life stages are killed by ionizing radiation.

> **Problem**
> 
> What will be the effect of different acidity levels within the surrounding environment on the development of the brine shrimp?
> 
> **Hypothesis and Experimental Setup**

This experiment investigated the effects of modulating pH on *A. salina* nauplii survival rates. The null hypothesis is: “Addition of sulfuric acid to water will not affect the proportion of surviving brine shrimp.” The alternative hypothesis is: “If sulfuric acid is added to water to make it more acidic, then the proportion of brine shrimp that survive over the course of the experiment will decrease.”

There were three petri dishes making up three experimental groups. Each petri dish was filled with saltwater with brine shrimp. The groups are as follows: a control group in which no acid was added to the saltwater, a treatment group with a water pH of 7, and a treatment group with a water pH of 6. Sulfuric acid was added to the treatment groups to decrease pH, and as such, the amount of pH was the independent variable. During the experiment, the number of brine shrimp dead and alive was measured over 24-hour intervals to reflect a dependent variable of brine shrimp viability

**Materials and Procedures**

To conduct an experiment to test these hypotheses, the following materials were gathered:

  - > Salt based water (50 mL) in a large container

  - > 3 Petri Dishes

  - > Sulfuric Acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)

  - > Brine Shrimp

  - > Sharpies

  - > Masking tape

  - > Three 50 mL beakers

  - > 10 mL graduated cylinder

  - > Pipette

  - > Shoebin with brine shrimp and salt-based water

  - > Light source

Using these materials, the following procedure was followed:

1)  > 3 petri dishes were labeled with masking tape and a sharpie as “Control pH = 8”, ‘“Experimental group \#1 pH = 7”, and “Experimental group \#2 pH = 6”. The appropriate identification of all three petri dishes was also labeled(in this case, Table 5 Period 4)

2)  > A 50 mL beaker was used to scoop saltwater out of a larger container. 30 mL of saltwater was measured out using the 10 mL graduated cylinder and added to each petri dish.

3)  > Sulfuric acid was added to each petri dish until the pH of the two treatment groups were in correspondence with their assigned labels.

4)  > A 50 mL beaker was used to scoop from the shoebin with brine shrimp, and was exposed to light.

5)  > A pipette was used to transfer brine shrimp from the beaker into another beaker to reduce the volume of eggs.

6)  > A pipette was used to squirt brine shrimp into each petri dish from the container.

7)  > The number in each petri dish of brine shrimp was counted and recorded; a light on each petri dish while counting to clearly see the shrimp. Record this in the data table.

8)  > Return to the petri dishes 24 hours and 48 hours after they were set up. Count the number of live and dead brine shrimp in each petri dish; shine a light on each petri dish while counting to clearly see the shrimp.

**Constants**

It is important to ensure only the independent variable changes during an experiment, in this case, the pH of water in each petri dish. All other variables must be controlled. Some constants include the water temperature, which remained constant as the petri dishes were kept within an air-conditioned classroom and stored in the same shelf when not in use. In addition, the time intervals between the groups were kept consistent; this includes the time of day each experimental group was set up and the time of day data was collected from each group (both of which were either near 12:00 or 12:30), as well as the length of time that data was collected (over two days). Finally, the salinity of the water in each petri dish was kept constant, given that the water was derived from the same two containers (one with saltwater and one with brine shrimp).

**Data**

**Table 1: Brine Shrimp Viability**

|         |    | 0 hours |      | 24 hours |      | 48 hours |      |
| ------- | -- | ------- | ---- | -------- | ---- | -------- | ---- |
| Dish \# | pH | Alive   | Dead | Alive    | Dead | Alive    | Dead |
| 1       | 8  | 10      | 0    | 15       | 0    | 12       | 2    |
| 2       | 7  | 11      | 0    | 18       | 2    | 9        | 4    |
| 3       | 6  | 10      | 0    | 17       | 1    | 17       | 3    |

![Chart](assets/img/2022-08-25-Google-Doc-Post/media/image1.png)

**Discussion and Conclusions**

Conclusive results cannot be drawn due to a number of confounding factors. Some of these include brine shrimp eggs that were placed in the petri dishes along with the live brine shrimp. A number of eggs hatched during the period between the first two data collections, resulting in an increase in the number of brine shrimp in each setup. In addition, some individuals observed during the second data collection were not found, alive or dead, in the third (one in the control and 7 in the pH 7 setup). All data collection was done manually in periods of 5 minutes each, likely resulting in random error.

If a future experiment were conducted, more accurate results can be achieved by implementing an automatic counting system and extracting only hatched brine shrimp from the original holding container. A repetition of the experiment with the changes made above would be helpful in taking data leading to conclusive results. Consideration of further research avenues may proceed following the procurement of genuine results.
