### Wireframe
We also made wireframes using Canva to plan out our project and also design our website before actually making it. It helped prevent errors and problems by fixing and thinking everything through beforehand. We designed all our pages through the wireframme before coding for it in VSCode.

### Problems
We did run into a few problems while making our final project.
- One of our problems was formatting the website's background
    - We had to make it so that the aspect ratio was applicable to any screen size
    - Some computers showed the background being cut off
- Another problem we had was getting our API to work
    - At first, we couldn't extract the questions from our URL and we couldn't access the JSON file
    - After we figured that out, we couldn't figure out how to call the backend code for API in the frontend
        - We have not yet figured this out but we are working on connecting our API to our frontend

### Progress
We have made considerable progress in our final project. 

This first screenshot shows the homepage for our final project website, named Practice Nexus. We have cards for our two quizzes, a math quiz and a geography quiz. The page is also designed with different colors and images, with a navigation bar to access different parts of the website.

This second screenshot shows the about us page for our final project website. The page introduces all the team members with the following information:
- Role - Scrum Master, Frontend, Backend, DevOps
- Age/Grade
- Favorite things to do
- Link to fastpages

We stil have to finish up some designing, as well as implementing our API into frontend. Once we do that, we also have to design each individual quiz page so that one question pops up at a time and answer choices can be selected. We might also include a scoring page, where we keep track of how many questions the user got right/wrong. 
- We plan to finish this by our design by splitting up the work while also keeping track of everyone else's work and posting any problems/issues.
    - Backend developers - Me and Luke - will work on coding for scores and also make/use API to get the questions into the Frontend
    - Frontend developers - Adi and Arnav - will implement the API and use it to get questions into the quiz pages. They will also design all the pages
    - Since backend doesn't have as much work, backend developers will also help design and plan out the pages for the quizzes
