## About CSU San Marcos
CSU San Marcos was one of the few with a good Physics program. It also has a smaller population, which enables students to get closer to faculty and make closer relationships. CSU San Marcos is a relatively new campus, and was originally a poultry farm before it was transformed into a college. Many engineering buildings have been built and there are some planned to be built. Over 250 stairs are at the campus. There are multiple pathways present in CSU Marcos - Computer Engineering (Starting this fall), Applied Physics, Math, Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, etc. Many departments as well: Physics, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Biological Sciences, Math, Computer Science, etc. Many STEM clubs active in campus - Cybersecurity Club, Robotics, 3D Printing, Women in STEM, etc.

## Takeaways
Through this opportunity, I learned much more about the California State University at San Marcos, such as its classes and departments. I learned about pathways I can take there and good opportunities given at CSUSM. I also learned about scholarships, grants, loans, internships, and more. I learned about advantanges and downfalls of doing certain things and I gained advice about college applications. I also was able to narrow down my choice of college majors/pathway and what colleges I should apply to. At the end of class we did a small hands-on experience with electrical engineering, which was not only fun and interactive, but piqued my interest in the engineering field.
