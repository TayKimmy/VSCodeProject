## Missed Questions

### Question #9

I got this question wrong because I forgot that encryption provides security. Bandwidth is basically how much data can be transferred, as well as redundant routing. I was confused because I saw public-key and I thought it wasn't as secure, when it is.

### Question #40

I got this question wrong because I forgot what a certificate authority does. I thought it validated the security of a website because when we deployed and used Certbot, the website became secure. But, the certificate authority does this by verifying the encryption keys, not by certifying the security.

### Question #57

I got this question wrong because I forgot the purpose of protocols in the Internet. It is related to communication between devices, but it not to ensure a speed above a minimum. It is to establish a format for messages sent between devices on the Internet.
