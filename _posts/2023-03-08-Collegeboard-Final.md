## Missed Questions
This is a table containing the questions I missed.
| Question # | Why I missed |
| - | - |
| 33 | I got this question wrong because I was careless. I forgot that repeat 1 time is basically not necessary because the code will do it once either way. |
| 41 | I got this question wrong because I misunderstood the topic of binary search. I thought the values had to be stored as a specific base but in reality, the only thing that matters is that the contents are sorted and ordered. |
| 42 | Similar to the last question, I misunderstood binary search. Since the list included both positive and negative numbers, I thought binary search shouldn't be used. However, binary search shouldn't be used because the list is not sorted. |
| 49 | I got this question wrong because I didn't know the limitations of simulations. Many simulations require observed data, but that is not necessarily a limitation. The limitation is that simulations can often omit details so that it is easier to implement. |
