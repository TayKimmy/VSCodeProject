## Questions I struggled with
I mainly struggled with questions that required a lot of reading - such as those with big tables and a lot of description - or those with binary/ other technical aspects:
- Q1 - I almost forgot that the beginning of binary = 1, not 2.
- Q2-6 - I needed a refesher about which one was lossless and which one was lossy
- Q16,18-21,23 - All these questions had big data tables and it was hard for me to read carefully

Ultimately, I did really well with questiosn that talked about analyzing data and questions about databases.
