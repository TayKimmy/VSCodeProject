## What is N@TM
Night At The Museums - also abbreviated N@TM - is an event where fine arts students and computer science students can show off their artworks and projects. It takes place at Del Norte at the end of the trimester, and lasts one night. Classes that participate include AP Studio Art, Drawing and Painting, 3D Animations, CSP, CSA, Ceramics, Digital Media, and more. During the event, all the students, as well as their parents, are invited to come to have fun and look at other peoples' achievements. The band also plays music outside for people to listen to.
