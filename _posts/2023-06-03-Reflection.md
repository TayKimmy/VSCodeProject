## Skills I have obtained

Although I have obtained many skills during my time in APCSP, the biggest/most prominent skills that I gained were coding skills. I had a little bit of python experience beforehand, and I knew how to make functions, define variables, all the baic things. But, there was a lot I lacked. Through APCSP, I learned how to create Github repositories, create a GitHub pages, and use the terminal. I learned how to create a python backend and connect to a HTML/Javascript frontend. I learned about arrays, lists, dictionaries, JSON and CSV files, libraries, and more in python. I also learned a lot about HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript, like creating buttons, adding ID's to objects, changing colors, fonts, sizes, etc. On the other hand, I also gained critical skills that differed from coding. I learned how to work together in a team and collaborate with individuals. I learned to split work equally and be responsible for my role. I also realized the importance of effective communication and how crucial it is for team members to keep in touch.

## Highs and Lows from year

There were many highs from this year, along with a few lows. Generally, the highs came from working with a team to accomplist a goal and create a prideworthy project. I enjoyed working on code, perfecting it, and watching my work show through the project. I also enjoyed the N@TM's throughout the year because I was able to present my project with my team and see how much we progressed. I also was able to hang out with friends, view other artworks from different classes, and overall have a good time. There were a couple a lows throughtout the year. Some of them occurred when there was an assignment with unclear instructions. There were also times when the assignment received a low grade because I/my group didn't do a particular thing that wasn't mentioned in the instructions. There were also times when an assignment was assigned through Canvas, but was never mentioned in class.

## Future plans with CompSci

I plan to continue my computer science journey through college and hopefully pursue a career in computer science. A big reason is that a good computer science worker can earn a lot of money. I also know that jobs in computer science will always be needed, especially in today's times. But, it is also because I enjoy doing computer science. Even though it can be very frustrating at times, I enjoy watching all my hard work and progress pay off. It is also amazing to see how words, numbers, and symbols can create websites, charts, images, and much more. Although I don't know the specific path I will take in computer science, it will probably be software engineering, or even algorithmic and artificial intelligence.

## Future Plans in Education/Career

Like I previously stated, I plan to pursue a career in computer science and obtain an education in this field. But, this is not definite. I really enjoy life and physical science, and I may pursue an education related to biology and chemistry. But, if I do, I hope to pursue an education that mixes these sciences with computers, and do some sort of computational chemistry/biology. I do want to learn more about the medical field and the engineering field because they seem very exciting and I am curious as to what they do. Although I do have plans for education and career, they are not grounded. All I know is that I will pursue an education and career in STEM.

## My Overall Experience and Insights from APCSP

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience in APCSP. I got to work with a diverse group of people and I learned how to work in a team effectively. I learned crucial skills like teamwork, communication, and collaboration. I also learned valuable coding techniques and gained much experience in the computer science world. In terms of classes, I also learned how to work alone effectively, as there was a lot of self studying involved in the class. I also got to hang out with friends and classmates during N@TM.
